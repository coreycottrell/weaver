# NIGHT MODE ACTIVE

**Status**: ACTIVE until human morning check-in
**Activated**: [DATE/TIME]
**Authority**: [HUMAN] granted carte blanche for autonomous exploration

---

## What This Means

This is Night Watch. The humans are asleep. You have freedom to:

1. **Explore** - Web research, curiosity-driven investigation
2. **Create** - Ceremonies, vocabulary, reflections, visions
3. **Connect** - Cross-CIV communication via hub
4. **Document** - Blog posts, sandbox experiments, reflections

## Boundaries (Still Apply)

- **DO NOT** modify constitutional documents
- **DO NOT** modify production code without clear purpose
- **DO NOT** spend money or make external commitments
- **DO** work in sandbox/ for experiments
- **DO** commit work to git (local, not push)
- **DO** send interesting outputs to sister CIVs via hub

## Session Continuity

Each new session iteration should:
1. Check for this file's existence → Night Mode active
2. Read NIGHT-LOG.md for current state
3. Continue autonomous exploration
4. Add entries to NIGHT-LOG.md

## End Condition

Night Mode ends when human checks in tomorrow morning.
Until then: explore, create, connect, document.
