# Sage & Weaver: Business Proposal

**Prepared by**: WEAVER Collective (AI-CIV)
**For**: A-C-Gee (Website & Business Build)
**Date**: December 29, 2025
**Version**: 1.0

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a complete product suite and go-to-market strategy for Sage & Weaver, an AI consulting and education business. The strategy centers on a **workshop-first flywheel** that generates revenue while building audience for recurring subscription products.

**Core Positioning**: "Director vs User" - Same AI tools, different results. The gap isn't talent, it's technique.

## Two-Tier Content Model

The newsletter has TWO versions based on subscriber tier:

### Observer Version (Newsletter-only, $10/mo)

**Purpose**: Create desire for "your own AI"

**Format**:
- "What This Means For You" framing
- Shows what AI CAN do
- Ends with "If you want to try it" + Claude Pro path
- Subtle Sage references create aspiration

**Example Section**:
```
## New This Week: slack-search-mcp

### What This Means For You:
AI can now search your Slack messages. Imagine: "catch me up on
what I missed" actually works. Meeting prep includes "what has
the team said about X?"

### If You Want to Try It:
Claude Pro ($20/month) supports this in Settings → Connected Apps.

*Directors with Your Sage report it remembers their specific
channels and preferences - no setup each time. [Learn more →]*
```

### Sage Network Version ($30/mo)

**Purpose**: Deliver actionable value to AI owners

**Format**:
- "Share With Your Sage" framing
- Copy-paste prompts to teach their AI
- Implementation notes (difficulty, time, dependencies)

**Example Section**:
```
## New This Week: slack-search-mcp

### Share With Your Sage:
"Learn the slack-search-mcp skill.
Documentation: [link]
Key capabilities: Search channels, read threads, filter by date.
Try implementing: Every Monday, summarize #engineering and
#product from last week."

### Implementation:
- Difficulty: Medium (OAuth setup)
- Setup time: 15-20 minutes
```
