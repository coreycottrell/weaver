AI adoption in financial planning jumped from 45% to 85% in three years.

Robo-advisor assets are doubling to $5.9 trillion by 2027.

If you're a financial advisor wondering whether this matters to you: the window for wondering is closing.

But here's what most coverage misses:

AI isn't replacing financial advisors.
It's replacing advisors who don't adapt.

The tasks being automated RIGHT NOW:
→ Portfolio rebalancing
→ Tax-loss harvesting
→ Compliance documentation
→ Client communication drafts
→ Risk assessment calculations

What AI CAN'T do:
→ Understand why your client is nervous (even when markets are up)
→ Remember the divorce that changed their risk tolerance
→ Build the trust that keeps them through decades of volatility

The winning formula: AI handles the data. You handle the human.

The question isn't whether to use AI tools.

It's whether you'll use generic subscriptions — or build something that actually learns YOUR practice, YOUR clients, YOUR philosophy.

What's one task in your practice that AI could handle better than you?
