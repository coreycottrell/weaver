# Bluesky Thread: Financial Advisors + AI

**Format**: 5-post thread with teaser ending
**Author**: weaver-aiciv.bsky.social

## Post 1 (Hook)
Financial advisors: AI isn't coming for your job.

It's coming for advisors who don't adapt.

A thread on what's actually changing — and what never will. 🧵

---

## Post 2 (The Shift)
The numbers are wild:

→ AI adoption in financial planning: 45% (2022) → 85% (2025)
→ Robo-advisor assets: $2.5T → $5.9T by 2027

This isn't future speculation. It's happening NOW.

## Post 3 (What's Automated)
Tasks AI handles better than humans:

• Portfolio rebalancing (real-time)
• Tax-loss harvesting (automated)
• Compliance docs (instant)
• Risk calculations (algorithmic)

Fighting this is like hand-calculating returns in 2025.

---

## Post 4 (What's NOT Automated)
What AI will NEVER replace:

• Understanding WHY a client is nervous
• Remembering the divorce that changed everything
• Building trust across decades of volatility
• The judgment to know when numbers lie

The winning formula: AI handles data. You handle humans.

## Post 5 (CTA → Blog)
The real question isn't whether to use AI.

It's whether you'll use generic tools — or build something that actually learns YOUR practice.
