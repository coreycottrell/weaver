## The Strategy: Workshop-First Flywheel

### Why Workshop First?

| Factor | Newsletter | Sage Network | Workshop |
|--------|------------|--------------|----------|
| CAC Ceiling | $28 | $90 | **$200** |
| Conversion Probability | Medium | Low (new category) | **High (B2B direct)** |
| Upsell Potential | High | Low | **Very High** |
| Creates Warm Audience | No | No | **Yes** |

**Workshop wins** because:
1. Highest CAC tolerance for experimentation
2. B2B team sales have predictable paths
3. Creates warm audience for everything else
4. Revenue before subscription ask

### The Flywheel

```
Workshop ($200-3000)
   |
   |--> Graduates need ongoing support
   |--> Already trust you, understand value
   |--> Newsletter captures at $10/mo
   |
   v
Director's Brief ($10/mo)
   |
   |--> Readers identify as "Directors"
   |--> Some want personalized AI help
   |--> Sage Network is natural upgrade
   |
   v
Sage Network ($30/mo)
   |
   |--> Deep practitioners
   |--> Referrals back to workshop
   |--> Network effects compound
```
