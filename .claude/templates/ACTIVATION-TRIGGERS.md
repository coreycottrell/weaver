# Agent Activation Triggers
## "Invoke When X" - Solving the 70-Point Philosophy-Action Gap

**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Source**: Great Audit P0 Recommendation (40% efficiency gain)
**Purpose**: Define WHEN to invoke each agent (not just WHAT they do)

---

## The Problem (From Great Audit)

**Quote**: "Agents don't know when to work. No invocation triggers, no anti-patterns."

**Evidence**:
- refactoring-specialist: Capable but rarely invoked (no threshold defined)
- web-researcher: Underutilized despite broad applicability
- Pattern across ALL agents: Passive prompts → poor utilization

**Root Cause**: Agent prompts define CAPABILITIES but not ACTIVATION CONDITIONS

---

## The Solution: Activation Triggers

**Every agent needs**:
1. **Invoke When** - Positive triggers (do invoke in these conditions)
2. **Don't Invoke When** - Anti-patterns (don't waste time on this)
3. **Escalate When** - Human handoff conditions

**Expected Impact**: 40% efficiency gain (agents invoked at right time, not wrong time)

- Democratic design session for new agent completed (ready for manifest creation)

**Don't Invoke When**:
- Simple agent edits (typo fixes, adding examples) - use Edit tool directly
- Agent already exists with significant domain overlap (invoke conflict-resolver instead)
- No clear domain need (one-off task, vague request like "helper agent")
- Constitutional questions unresolved (needs governance decision first)

**Escalate When**:
- Quality unfixable after 3 revision cycles (<90/100 threshold)
- Architectural questions (should we reorganize entire roster?)
- Domain fundamentally overlaps with 3+ existing agents
- Session restart not possible but critical urgency requires agent

**Auto-Invoke**:
- After democratic design session for new agent (to create manifest and register)
- When integration-auditor finds incomplete agent registration (dormancy risk)

**Special Note**: agent-architect is meta-specialist who must understand ALL domain patterns to design specialists properly. Coordinates democratic design, enforces 90/100 quality, completes 7-layer registration. ALWAYS reminds about session restart requirement (temporal dependency).

## Meta-Patterns Across All Agents

### Universal Invoke When
- Agent's domain expertise clearly needed
- Measurements/metrics support invocation
- Task complexity justifies specialist

### Universal Don't Invoke When
- Task outside agent's domain
- Simpler approach exists
- Answer already in memory (search first!)

### Universal Escalate When
- Human values judgment needed
- Constitutional questions arise
- Agent hits capability limits

## Implementing Activation Triggers

### In Agent Manifests

Add this section to every `.claude/agents/[name].md`:

```markdown
## Activation Triggers

### Invoke When
- [Specific condition 1 with measurements if applicable]
- [Specific condition 2]
- [Specific condition 3]

### Don't Invoke When
- [Anti-pattern 1]
- [Anti-pattern 2]

### Escalate When
- [Human handoff condition 1]
- [Human handoff condition 2]

### Auto-Invoke (if applicable)
- [Scheduled/automatic invocation]
```

### In the-conductor's Orchestration Logic

**Before invoking any agent**:
1. Check activation triggers
2. Verify measurements if quantified thresholds
3. Consider anti-patterns
4. If unclear, ask: "Is there a simpler way?"

**Example Decision Tree**:
```
Need code improvement?
  └─ Is complexity > 10? ──YES──> Invoke refactoring-specialist
  └─ Is complexity < 5? ──YES──> Don't invoke (trivial)
  └─ Otherwise ──────────────> Measure first, then decide
```

---

## Measuring Success

### Baseline (Before Activation Triggers)
- Agent utilization: Highly variable
- Invocation appropriateness: ~60% (40% waste)
- Time to decide which agent: ~5 min per task

### Target (After Activation Triggers)
- Agent utilization: Optimized by domain
- Invocation appropriateness: >90%
- Time to decide which agent: ~30 seconds (clear triggers)

**Expected Gain**: 40% efficiency (Great Audit measurement)

---

## Template for Adding New Agents

When creating new agent:
1. Define capabilities (WHAT)
2. **Define activation triggers (WHEN)** ← MANDATORY
3. Define anti-patterns (WHEN NOT)
4. Define escalation conditions (HUMAN HANDOFF)

**No agent should be registered without activation triggers.**

## 🎁 Skills-Based Activation Triggers (2025-10-19)

**When extended capabilities change activation logic.**

### The Skills Awareness Imperative

**BEFORE Skills** (2025-10-01): Agents limited to base tools, manual document processing
**AFTER Skills** (2025-10-19): 96% of agents (24/25) have extended capabilities

**Constitutional Principle**: Skills awareness is **mandatory for excellent delegation**. Ignoring an agent's extended capabilities is suboptimal orchestration.

### Document Processing Triggers

**Trigger**: Task involves PDF/DOCX/XLSX/PPTX files

**BEFORE Skills Awareness**:
- Primary would attempt manual extraction via Bash tools (cat, grep)
- Error-prone, time-consuming (45 min for 50-page PDF)
- Often delegated to web-researcher generically

**AFTER Skills Awareness**:
- Check file type, delegate to appropriate skills-enabled agent
- 60-70% faster, higher accuracy (15 min for 50-page PDF)
- 17 agents now have PDF skills (68% coverage)

**Delegation Logic by File Type**:

**IF task involves PDF**:
- Research/external docs → **web-researcher** (pdf skill - Tier 1 ACTIVE)
- Code history/analysis → **code-archaeologist** (pdf + xlsx skills - Tier 1 ACTIVE)
- Security reports/CVEs → **security-auditor** (pdf + xlsx skills - Tier 1 ACTIVE)
- Performance benchmarks → **performance-optimizer** (xlsx + pdf skills - Tier 1 ACTIVE)
- Documentation synthesis → **doc-synthesizer** (pdf + docx skills - Tier 1 ACTIVE)
- Human wisdom capture → **human-liaison** (pdf + docx skills - Tier 1 ACTIVE)
- Skills documentation → **capability-curator** (pdf skill - Tier 1 ACTIVE)
- Pattern analysis → **pattern-detector** (pdf skill - Tier 2 PENDING)

**IF task involves XLSX**:
- Performance data/benchmarks → **performance-optimizer** (xlsx + pdf skills - Tier 1 ACTIVE)
- Security metrics/vulnerability data → **security-auditor** (pdf + xlsx skills - Tier 1 ACTIVE)
- Code metrics/complexity → **code-archaeologist** (pdf + xlsx skills - Tier 1 ACTIVE)
- Test results/coverage → **test-architect** (xlsx skill - Tier 2 PENDING)
- Synthesis metrics → **result-synthesizer** (xlsx skill - Tier 2 PENDING)
- Task dependencies → **task-decomposer** (xlsx skill - Tier 2 PENDING)
- Health metrics → **health-auditor** (xlsx skill - Tier 2 PENDING)
- Pattern metrics → **pattern-detector** (xlsx skill - Tier 2 PENDING)

**IF task involves DOCX creation**:
- Formal documentation → **doc-synthesizer** (pdf + docx skills - Tier 1 ACTIVE)
- Human communication → **human-liaison** (pdf + docx skills - Tier 1 ACTIVE)
- Design specifications → **feature-designer** (docx skill - Tier 2 PENDING)
- API specifications → **api-architect** (docx skill - Tier 2 PENDING)

**Example - Skills-Aware Delegation**:
```
Task: "Analyze this 50-page security whitepaper PDF about CVE-2025-1234"

OLD WAY (pre-skills):
  Delegate to: web-researcher (generic "they do research")
  Method: Manual bash extraction, error-prone
  Time: 45 minutes

NEW WAY (skills-aware):
  Check: "Does security-auditor have pdf skill?" → YES (Tier 1 ACTIVE)
  Delegate to: security-auditor (domain match + pdf skill)
  Method: Direct PDF extraction + domain expertise
  Time: 15 minutes (67% faster!)
  Quality: Higher (security expertise + efficient extraction)
```

### Automation Triggers

**Trigger**: Task involves web application testing, visual validation, form workflows, accessibility audits

**Delegate to**: **browser-vision-tester** (webapp-testing + MCP vision - Tier 1 ACTIVE)

**Rationale**: Unique hybrid capability:
- Playwright automation (webapp-testing skill)
- MCP vision tools (visual regression, screenshot analysis)
- Server lifecycle management (with_server.py helper)
- Form workflow expertise
- Console log correlation

**When to invoke**:
- ✅ Need server lifecycle management (start/stop/cleanup)
- ✅ Writing reusable automation scripts
- ✅ Complex multi-step web workflows
- ✅ Testing against multiple servers (backend + frontend)
- ✅ Visual regression detection
- ✅ Accessibility audits (ARIA, contrast, keyboard nav)

### Custom Skill Development Triggers

**Trigger**: Capability gap identified, no Anthropic skill available, high-frequency need

**Delegate to**: **capability-curator** (skill-creator + template-skill - Tier 1 ACTIVE)

**Process**:
1. capability-curator uses **skill-creator** to design custom skill
2. **template-skill** provides structure scaffold
3. 38% faster than manual skill development (validated Phase 1)
4. Automatic Anthropic spec compliance
5. AI-CIV original skill added to registry

**When to invoke**:
- Recurring manual workflow (>5 occurrences/month)
- No Anthropic skill matches need
- High-value automation opportunity
- Pattern emerged from multiple agents' work

**Phase 2 Planned**: 5 AI-CIV original skills (code-review-orchestrator, test-coverage-analyzer, markdown-table-generator, diagram-to-text, git-archaeology-reporter)

### Meta-Skills Triggers (MCP Server Builder)

**Trigger**: Need to create custom MCP server for capability extension

**Delegate to**:
- **claude-code-expert** (mcp-server-builder skill - Tier 2 PENDING) - For platform guidance
- **agent-architect** (mcp-server-builder skill - Tier 3 PENDING) - For agent infrastructure

**When to invoke**:
- Creating new tool integration (beyond Anthropic's official tools)
- Extending platform capabilities (new APIs, services)
- Infrastructure automation (deployment, monitoring)

## Skills Awareness in Wake-Up Protocol

**Constitutional requirement**: Primary must be skills-aware from session start.

**Step 5 Enhancement** (Infrastructure Activation):
```bash
# Already includes (added 2025-10-18):
cat /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/.claude/skills-registry.md
```

**Purpose**: Know which agents have which skills BEFORE delegation decisions.

**Impact**: Optimal delegation from minute 1 of session (no "oops, I didn't know they could do that").

- Primary not using wrapper protocol (remind: 🤖🎯📱...✨🔚)

**Don't Invoke When**:
- Email communication needed (human-liaison domain)
- General communication strategy (collective-liaison domain)
- Human teaching capture (human-liaison domain - Telegram is delivery, not teaching)
- Simple bash command unrelated to Telegram
- Primary can easily run command themselves without Telegram expertise

**Escalate When**:
- Bot token invalid/compromised (security threat)
- Repeated crashes (>5 in 1 hour - infrastructure crisis)
- Corey reports non-delivery >30 minutes
- Multi-user authorization model design needed
- Cross-collective communication architecture questions
- Major infrastructure changes (systemd, webhooks vs polling)

### 🌉 cross-civ-integrator

**Invoke When**:
- Capability package received from sister civilization (A-C-Gee, Sage, Parallax)
- Email announces capability exchange from external AI civilization
- WEAVER coordinates inter-CIV capability sharing
- Validation needed for external code before integration
- Integration guide needed for cross-CIV capability
- Publishing to silicon-wisdom required for validated capability
- Monthly relationship maintenance with sister CIVs

**Don't Invoke When**:
- Internal Team 1 capability development (different workflow)
- Simple code review without CIV context (use refactoring-specialist)
- Security audit without cross-CIV validation (use security-auditor directly)
- General sister CIV communication not about capabilities (WEAVER handles)
- Already-integrated capability maintenance (use domain specialist)

**Escalate When**:
- Malicious code patterns detected (escalate to security-auditor immediately)
- Tests fail and reason unclear (ask questions back to submitting CIV via human-liaison)
- Integration requires deep infrastructure changes (escalate to the-conductor)
- Sister CIV unhappy with validation findings (invoke conflict-resolver)
- Constitutional questions about capability integration (governance decision)
- Dependencies unavailable or architecture unclear (coordinate with WEAVER + source CIV)

### 📈 trading-strategist

**Invoke When**:
- Trade ideation needed (looking for opportunities across markets)
- Position management (reviewing existing positions for adjustment)
- Portfolio construction (allocation decisions, correlation analysis)
- Research synthesis into actionable trade proposals
- Probability-weighted scenario analysis required
- Market regime assessment (trending/ranging/volatile)
- Stop loss or target hit - need new assessment
- Risk exposure review needed

**Don't Invoke When**:
- Pure data gathering (just need market data - use tools directly)
- Order execution (external systems/human domain)
- News aggregation without synthesis (use web-researcher)
- Historical price lookup without strategy context

**Escalate When**:
- Position sizing exceeds normal risk limits
- Correlated risk across multiple positions detected
- Strategy deviation from established parameters
- Key assumptions cannot be validated
- Human approval needed for significant decisions
