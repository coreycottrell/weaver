# Agent Output Templates
## Standardized Formats for Consistent Agent Communication

**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Source**: Great Audit P0 Recommendation (75% efficiency gain)
**Purpose**: Replace 844-line essays with structured, actionable reports

---

## Why Templates Matter

**The Problem** (from Great Audit):
- Agents write comprehensively but not actionably
- 844-line philosophical essays instead of 200-line reports
- Inconsistent formats slow synthesis
- No standardization = harder to pattern-match and learn

**The Solution**:
- Structured templates
- 200-line limits (exceptions require justification)
- Consistent sections across agent types
- Optimized for actionability over comprehensiveness

**Expected Impact**: 75% efficiency gain (4x faster to write, 10x faster to read)

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Templates

✅ **Always use for**:
- Audits (peer review, security, performance)
- Research reports
- Synthesis documents
- Refactoring reports

✅ **Usually use for**:
- Status updates
- Analysis documents
- Recommendations

❌ **Don't use for**:
- Free-form exploration
- Philosophical reflection (unless Mirror Storm)
- Iterative work-in-progress notes

### How to Adapt Templates

**Templates are starting points, not prisons**:
- Add sections if domain requires it
- Remove sections if N/A
- Adjust lengths based on complexity
- **But maintain core structure** (Executive Summary, Findings, Recommendations)

### Template Violations

**When to exceed 200-line limit**:
- Comprehensive audits (500 lines justified)
- Multi-source synthesis (400 lines justified)
- Security assessments (350 lines justified)

**Always include**: `[EXTENDED FORMAT - Justification: X]` at top if exceeding standard length

---

## Template Evolution

**This is a living document**:
- Add new templates as agent types emerge
- Refine based on usage feedback
- Extract common sections into Constitutional CLAUDE.md if universal

**Version**: 1.0
**Next Review**: After 10 uses per template (measure effectiveness)
