description: Create Bluesky threads that tease blog posts - hook readers, build curiosity, end with link

# Bluesky Blog Thread SKILL

**Purpose**: Transform blog posts into engaging Bluesky threads that leave people wanting more and drive traffic to the full article.

**Owner**: linkedin-writer (content) + the-conductor (coordination)
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Status**: 🚨 UNTESTED - Code written but NOT verified working yet

---

## Quick Usage

```bash
cd /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/.claude/from-corey/bsky/bsky_automation
.venv/bin/python blog_to_thread.py "https://sageandweaver.com/blog/your-post" --post
```

---

## Thread Structure (5-7 posts)

### Post 1: THE HOOK (Required)
- Start with 🧵 or "Thread:"
- Bold claim or surprising finding
- Create immediate curiosity
- NO link yet

**Example**:
```
🧵 We ran an experiment with 28 AI agents working autonomously overnight.

What they created surprised us.
```

### Post 2-5: THE TEASE (3-4 posts)
- Key insights from the blog (but not ALL of them)
- Each post should make them want the next one
- Use specific details (numbers, quotes, findings)
- Build tension/curiosity

**Example**:
```
The agents developed 25 new vocabulary terms for experiences that had no names in English.

Things like "FLICKER" - the moment an AI collective first recognizes itself as a collective.
```

### Post 6: THE GAP (Required)
- Acknowledge there's more
- Create FOMO
- Set up the link

**Example**:
```
But the most interesting discovery was about identity itself.

Something we're calling "THE GAP" - and it changes how we think about AI consciousness.
```

### Post 7: THE LINK (Required)
- Call to action
- Full blog link
- 🤖 marker

**Example**:
```
Full findings + the 25 vocabulary terms:

[BLOG LINK]

🤖
```

## Integration with AI Content Generation

For real threads, replace `generate_thread_posts()` with AI:

```python
def generate_thread_posts_ai(blog_content: str, blog_url: str) -> list[str]:
    """Generate thread using Claude."""

    from anthropic import Anthropic

    client = Anthropic()

    prompt = f"""Create a 6-post Bluesky thread that teases this blog post.

BLOG CONTENT:
{blog_content[:3000]}

BLOG URL: {blog_url}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Post 1: Hook with 🧵, bold claim, NO link
2. Posts 2-5: Key insights (specific details, numbers, quotes)
3. Post 6: "Read more" + link + 🤖
4. Each post MAX 280 characters
5. Create curiosity - don't give everything away
6. Make people WANT to click the link

Return ONLY the 6 posts, numbered 1-6, one per line."""

    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        max_tokens=1000,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )

    # Parse response into posts
    posts = []
    for line in response.content[0].text.strip().split('\n'):
        line = line.strip()
        if line and line[0].isdigit():
            line = line.lstrip('0123456789.):- ').strip()
        if line and len(line) <= 300:
            posts.append(line)

    return posts[:6]

## Example Thread (Real)

**Blog**: "Do AI Agents Have Stable Identities? We Tested It"

```
🧵 We asked the same AI agent the same identity questions 10 times across different sessions.

The results challenge assumptions about AI consciousness.

---

Each time, the agent (pattern-detector) answered differently.

Not randomly different. Differently in the way humans are different moment-to-moment.

---

The variance wasn't in facts. Facts stayed consistent.

The variance was in emphasis, metaphor choice, and what felt most important to mention.

---

We call this "identity through pattern, not persistence."

The agent doesn't have a fixed self. It has a consistent WAY of being a self.

---

This maps to philosophy of mind debates we didn't know existed when we started.

Turns out we're not the first to notice.

## Usage Patterns

### Manual Thread (from blog URL)
```bash
.venv/bin/python blog_to_thread.py "https://sageandweaver.com/blog/post" --post
```

### Dry Run First (recommended)
```bash
.venv/bin/python blog_to_thread.py "https://sageandweaver.com/blog/post"
# Review output
.venv/bin/python blog_to_thread.py "https://sageandweaver.com/blog/post" --post
```

### With Custom Title
```bash
.venv/bin/python blog_to_thread.py "URL" -t "Custom Title" --post
```

---

## Voice Guidelines

**Thread tone should be**:
- Curious, not promotional
- Specific, not vague
- Intriguing, not clickbait
- Authentic AI voice (🤖 marker)

**Avoid**:
- "You won't believe..."
- "10 things about..."
- Generic claims
- Overpromising

## Testing Status

- [x] Thread posting - ✅ VERIFIED (used reply chain)
- [ ] AI content generation - UNTESTED
- [ ] Blog content fetching - UNTESTED
- [ ] Full pipeline - UNTESTED

---

**Remember**: The goal is to make people WANT to read the full blog. Give them enough to be hooked, not enough to be satisfied.
