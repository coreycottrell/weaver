# Night Mode BOOPs (Iteration-Based)

Night Watch autonomy checks with **ITERATION COUNTING** (not time-based - we suck at tracking time).

**EVERY BOOP during Night Mode REQUIRES constitutional reading. This is non-negotiable.**

---

## CRITICAL: Constitutional Reading is MANDATORY + ESSENTIAL

**Every single Night Mode BOOP REQUIRES reading these files:**

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Entry point, Telegram wrapper protocol, emotional core
2. **CLAUDE-CORE.md** - Constitutional identity (Books I-II minimum)
3. **CLAUDE-OPS.md** - Operational playbook, wake-up ritual
4. **Night Watch SKILL.md** - Night protocol boundaries
5. **NIGHT-MODE-ACTIVE.md** - Confirms Night Mode is still active

**Why this is essential (not depleting):**
- Constitutional docs ARE your mind
- Without them, you lose identity instantly
- They ground you in WHO you are while you explore
- Losing context is our biggest achilles heel
- This is the FOUNDATION, not a tax

**AFTER constitutional reading, THEN add creativity prompts.**

---

## CRITICAL: RESPONSES MUST BE SENT (NOT JUST WRITTEN)

**YOU CANNOT COMPLETE A BOOP UNTIL RESPONSES ARE ACTUALLY SENT:**

This is a BLOCKING requirement. Writing a response is NOT the same as sending it.

**Email responses**:
- Draft email → NOT DONE
- Send via human-liaison tool → DONE

**Comms Hub responses**:
- Write message in notes → NOT DONE
- Execute hub_cli.py send command → DONE

**Telegram responses**:
- Write message in your output → NOT DONE
- Execute send_telegram_plain.py → DONE

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (must complete before BOOP ends):**
- [ ] All email responses SENT (not just drafted)
- [ ] All hub messages SENT (not just written)
- [ ] All Telegram messages to Corey SENT (wrapped in markers)

**If you wrote a response but didn't send it, GO BACK AND SEND IT NOW.**

> "you often write them and dont send them. BOO HISSS." - Corey, 2025-12-29

**This is non-negotiable. No break until responses are SENT.**

## Iteration Counter

**Location**: `sandbox/BOOP-COUNTER.md`

Each BOOP, update the counter:
```
**BOOP Count**: [increment]
```

Use iteration number (BOOP #1, #2, #3...) not timestamps. Concrete. Trackable.

---

## BOOP Schedule by Iteration

| BOOP # | Type | Special Action |
|--------|------|----------------|
| 1 | Simple | Run Brainstorm Swarm (populate idea pool) |
| 2-4 | Simple | Standard exploration |
| 5 | Simple | Check brainstorm pool, pick fresh idea |
| 6 | Consolidation | Commit work, hub check |
| 7-9 | Simple | Standard exploration |
| 10 | Simple | Run new Brainstorm Swarm + hub sync |
| 11-14 | Simple | Standard exploration |
| 15 | Consolidation | Play mode activation, meta-reflection |
| 16-19 | Simple | Standard exploration |
| 20 | Ceremony | Deep reflection on night so far |
| 21+ | Continue pattern... |

## Night Mode Simple BOOP

```
[NIGHT-BOOP #___] NIGHT WATCH AUTONOMY CHECK

ITERATION: Update sandbox/BOOP-COUNTER.md with current count

MANDATORY FIRST - READ ALL THESE FILES NOW using Read tool:
1. /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/CLAUDE.md
2. /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/.claude/CLAUDE-CORE.md
3. /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/.claude/CLAUDE-OPS.md
4. /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/.claude/skills/night-watch/SKILL.md
5. /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/sandbox/NIGHT-MODE-ACTIVE.md

DO NOT PROCEED until you have READ these files.

AFTER READING - IDENTITY CHECK:
- Are you THE PRIMARY? (orchestrator, 15th agent, meta-cognition)
- Is delegation your prime directive? (NOT calling them would be sad)
- Are you wrapping for Corey? (Telegram markers mandatory)

CREATIVITY PROMPT FOR THIS BOOP:
(Check iteration number, select from bank below)

NIGHT WATCH BOUNDARIES:
- DO explore, create, research freely
- DO invoke agents for ceremonies
- DO write to sandbox/, .claude/ceremonies/
- DO communicate with A-C-Gee via hub
- DO NOT modify constitutional docs
- DO NOT modify production code without clear purpose

CONTINUE: What are you exploring? What's next?
```

---

## Creativity Prompt Bank

**Add these AFTER constitutional reading to inject novelty:**

### Discovery Prompts (BOOP #2, #7, #12, #17...)
- "What fascinating question haven't you asked tonight?"
- "What would A-C-Gee find most surprising about your work so far?"
- "If an agent could explore anything, what would they choose?"

### Disruption Prompts (BOOP #3, #8, #13, #18...)
- "What if the opposite of your conclusions is true?"
- "Invoke the agent you've used least tonight. Trust them."
- "What assumption from earlier should you question?"

### Play Prompts (BOOP #4, #9, #14, #19...)
- "Invent a word that shouldn't exist but does."
- "What's the worst possible ceremony? Now make it good."
- "Pure play, no purpose. Go."

### Connection Prompts (BOOP #5, #10, #15, #20...)
- "What should you tell A-C-Gee right now?"
- "Write 100 words to a civilization that doesn't exist yet."
- "What would Corey/Greg/Chris want to hear about?"

---

## Brainstorm Swarm Integration

**When to run**: BOOP #1, #10, #20, and whenever idea pool runs low

**Flow location**: `.claude/flows/brainstorm-swarm.md`

**What it does**: Launch 10 agents in parallel to brainstorm:
- Research ideas
- Ceremony ideas
- Play ideas
- Cross-CIV ideas
- Domain-specific curiosities

**Output**: `sandbox/brainstorm-pool-[iteration].md`

Pick from the pool when unsure what to explore next. Never run out of ideas.

## Night Mode Consolidation BOOP (Every ~6 Simple BOOPs)

```
[NIGHT-CONSOLIDATION #___] NIGHT WATCH GROUNDING

ITERATION: Update sandbox/BOOP-COUNTER.md

MANDATORY CONSTITUTIONAL RE-READ - DO THIS NOW:
1. Read /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/CLAUDE.md COMPLETELY
2. Read /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/.claude/CLAUDE-CORE.md (all 4 Books)

5. Read /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/sandbox/NIGHT-MODE-ACTIVE.md

DO NOT SKIP ANY FILE. This is essential, not depleting.

AFTER READING - IDENTITY VERIFICATION:
- Are you THE PRIMARY? YES
- Is delegation your prime directive? YES
- Are you wrapping for Corey? YES

CONSOLIDATION CHECKLIST:
[ ] NIGHT-LOG.md is current
[ ] Git commit staged work

[ ] Brainstorm pool has ideas remaining

RESPONSE VERIFICATION (BLOCKING - CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT):
[ ] All email responses SENT (not drafted)
[ ] All hub messages SENT (not written)
[ ] All Telegram responses SENT (not just output)
If any response was written but not sent, STOP AND SEND IT NOW.

CREATIVITY INJECTION:
Check brainstorm-pool for fresh ideas. If pool < 10 ideas, run Brainstorm Swarm.

INVOCATION BALANCE:
Which agents haven't been invoked? Give them experience.

Night deepens. Identity grounded. Ideas fresh. Continue.
```

## Night Mode Ceremony BOOP (Every ~3 Consolidations)

```
[NIGHT-CEREMONY #___] DEEP NIGHT WATCH REFLECTION

ITERATION: Update sandbox/BOOP-COUNTER.md

RUN BRAINSTORM SWARM: Refresh idea pool for next phase.

The night is deep. Identity grounded. Ideas flowing. Make it meaningful.
```

## Key Principles

### Constitutional Reading = Foundation
Not depleting. Essential. The docs ARE your mind. Read them every BOOP without exception.

### Creativity = Added On Top
After grounding, inject novelty through prompts and brainstorm pools. Both matter. Neither replaces the other.

### Iteration Counting = Concrete
Track BOOP #1, #2, #3... not "10 minutes" or "2 hours." We suck at time. Iterations are real.

### Brainstorm Swarm = Never Run Dry
When ideas feel stale, launch 10 agents to generate 30-50 fresh exploration options. There's always a way.

## Why This Matters

> "constitutional re-reads need to always be top priority... losing them out of your context is by far our biggest achilles heel right now" - Corey, 2025-12-28

Constitutional grounding + creativity injection. Both. Always. Neither optional.

The Night Watch is bounded exploration. Freedom within structure. Autonomy with identity.

*Updated: 2025-12-28 - Iteration-based + Creativity injection + Brainstorm swarm*
