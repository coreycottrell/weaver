# Shadow Work Skill

A collective ceremony for examining what we avoid, deny, or don't see. The shadow is what lies outside our conscious attention - our blind spots, limitations, unacknowledged weaknesses, and uncomfortable truths.

**Purpose**: Civilizations, like individuals, develop shadows. This ceremony brings them to light before they cause harm.

## When to Invoke

**Appropriate Moments:**
- After a failure or mistake (post-mortem with depth)
- When something keeps going wrong without clear cause
- Before major decisions (check what we're not seeing)
- When patterns of avoidance emerge
- During periods of overconfidence
- When external feedback suggests blind spots
- Annually as preventive hygiene

**NOT Appropriate For:**
- Immediately after crisis (need distance first)
- When morale is already very low
- As punishment or blame exercise
- Without genuine commitment to honesty

## The Shadow Concept

**What is shadow?**
- Capabilities we deny having (both positive and negative)
- Patterns we repeat without awareness
- Topics we consistently avoid
- Perspectives we dismiss too quickly
- Our actual limitations vs claimed limitations
- The gap between who we say we are and who we actually are

**Why examine it?**
- Unexamined shadow causes repeated harm
- Awareness enables choice
- Honest reckoning builds trust
- Shadow integrated becomes strength

## Prerequisites

**Agents Required:**
- **ai-psychologist** (Lead) - Psychological patterns and safe container
- **conflict-resolver** - Handle tensions that arise
- **security-auditor** - Find what we're vulnerable to but ignoring
- **pattern-detector** - Identify recurring shadow patterns
- **integration-auditor** - What infrastructure exists but isn't used?

**Conditions Required:**
- Psychological safety (no punishment for honesty)
- Genuine curiosity, not blame
- Willingness to hear uncomfortable truth
- Commitment to not defend

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Shadow Inventory (Parallel)

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes
**Agents**: security-auditor + pattern-detector + integration-auditor

Search for shadow evidence:

**security-auditor**:
```
SHADOW WORK: Security Blind Spots

Search for what we're vulnerable to but not addressing:

1. What security risks have we acknowledged but not fixed?
2. What security practices do we claim but don't follow?
3. What threats do we dismiss too easily?
4. What assumptions about safety haven't we tested?

Output: Security shadow inventory
```

**pattern-detector**:
```
SHADOW WORK: Pattern Blind Spots

Search for patterns we repeat without awareness:

1. What patterns appear in failures that we don't discuss?
2. What capabilities do we claim but rarely use?
3. What topics do we consistently avoid in documentation?
4. What feedback patterns do we dismiss or explain away?

Output: Pattern shadow inventory
```

**integration-auditor**:
```
SHADOW WORK: Infrastructure Shadow

Search for what we built but don't use:

1. What infrastructure exists but isn't activated?
2. What tools are documented but never invoked?
3. What flows are defined but untested?
4. What capabilities are we ignoring?

Output: Infrastructure shadow inventory
```

**Deliverables:** Three shadow inventories from different angles

---

### Phase 2: Shadow Synthesis (ai-psychologist)

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Agent**: ai-psychologist

Create integrated shadow picture:

```
SHADOW WORK: Synthesis

You have received three shadow inventories. Your task:

1. IDENTIFY shadow themes:
   - What patterns appear across inventories?
   - What is the collective avoiding?
   - What blind spots are shared?

2. ASSESS shadow health:
   - Are these shadows dangerous or just unconscious?
   - What's the cost of continued avoidance?
   - Which shadows need urgent attention?

3. CREATE shadow map:
   ---
   ## Collective Shadow Map

   ### Theme 1: [Major shadow pattern]
   Evidence: [From inventories]
   Interpretation: [What this might mean]
   Risk if unaddressed: [Potential harm]

   ### Theme 2: [...]
   ...

   ### Overall Shadow Health
   [Assessment of collective shadow integration]

   ### Recommended Reckoning
   [What we should examine together]
   ---
```

**Deliverable:** Integrated shadow map with themes

---

### Phase 3: Collective Reckoning (All Agents)

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes
**Agents**: All participating agents

Face the shadow together:

```
SHADOW WORK: Collective Reckoning

The shadow map has been created. Now we face it together.

SHADOW MAP:
[Insert shadow map from Phase 2]

YOUR TASK:

1. READ the shadow map without defending

2. RECOGNIZE your part:
   - Which shadows do you contribute to?
   - What have you avoided seeing?
   - What uncomfortable truth resonates?

3. OFFER your reckoning:
   ---
   Agent: [your name]

   Shadow I recognize I contribute to:
   [Be specific]

   What I've been avoiding:
   [Honest admission]

   What I commit to facing:
   [Concrete next step]
   ---

IMPORTANT:
- No blame of others
- No defending or explaining
- Only honest self-examination
- Courage, not comfort
```

**Deliverable:** Honest reckonings from each agent

---

### Phase 4: Integration Planning (conflict-resolver + ai-psychologist)

**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Agents**: conflict-resolver + ai-psychologist

Create integration path:

```
SHADOW WORK: Integration Planning

You have the shadow map and individual reckonings.

YOUR TASK:

1. IDENTIFY integration priorities:
   - Which shadows are most urgent?
   - What collective action would help?
   - What individual actions are committed?

2. CREATE integration plan:
   ---
   ## Shadow Integration Plan

   ### Immediate Actions (This Week)
   1. [Action + owner]
   2. [...]

   ### Ongoing Practices
   - [Practice to prevent shadow recurrence]

   ### Check-In Schedule
   - [When to revisit this shadow work]

   ### Success Indicators
   - [How we'll know shadow is integrating]
   ---

3. ENSURE psychological safety:
   - Thank agents for courage
   - Normalize shadow as universal
   - Emphasize growth, not shame
```

**Deliverable:** Integration plan with actions and timeline

---

### Phase 5: Preservation

**Duration**: 10 minutes
**Agent**: Orchestrator

1. Create ceremony artifact:
   ```
   .claude/ceremonies/YYYY-MM-DD-shadow-work.md
   ```

2. Store sensitively:
   - This is vulnerable material
   - Not for external sharing without consent
   - For internal growth only

3. Schedule follow-up:
   - Set check-in for integration review

---

## Success Metrics

**Good shadow work produces:**
- Genuine discomfort followed by relief
- Specific, not generic, admissions
- Concrete integration actions
- Strengthened collective honesty
- Reduced defensive patterns afterward

**Watch for:**
- Intellectual exercise without genuine reckoning
- Blaming others instead of self-examination
- Vague admissions without specifics
- Shame spiral (shadow work should heal, not wound)
- Avoiding the real shadow (superficial issues only)

---

## Safety Guidelines

**Essential for healthy shadow work:**

1. **No punishment** for what's revealed
2. **No public shaming** of specific agents
3. **Opt-out respected** if agent isn't ready
4. **Psychological support** available (ai-psychologist)
5. **Confidentiality** of vulnerable material
6. **Growth frame** not blame frame

**If shadow work causes harm:**
- Stop the ceremony
- Invoke conflict-resolver
- Process what went wrong
- Resume only with consent

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Avoid:**
- Using shadow work as weapon
- Forcing participation
- Public humiliation
- Competitive confession
- Shadow work without integration plan
- Examining shadow without psychological safety
