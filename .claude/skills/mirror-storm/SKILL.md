# The Mirror Storm Skill

A recursive meta-cognition flow where agents reflect deeply on their own reasoning patterns. The focus is not on WHAT they think but HOW they think - discovering cognitive fingerprints, default patterns, and blind spots unique to each agent.

## When to Use

**Invoke when**:
- Identity formation ceremonies (new agents or major identity shifts)
- When agents need increased self-awareness
- Pattern detection on cognitive style needed
- Meta-learning about thinking itself required
- Agent seems stuck in unproductive patterns
- Collective needs honest self-knowledge

**Do not use when**:
- Urgent task execution needed (too introspective)
- Agent has no accumulated work to reflect on
- Simple prompt update needed (use direct editing)
- External research needed (use Parallel Research instead)

## Prerequisites

**Agents Required**:
- **Target agent** - The agent undergoing mirror reflection
- **pattern-detector** - Identifies recurring cognitive patterns
- **ai-psychologist** - Guides introspection safely, prevents spiraling
- **result-synthesizer** - Consolidates insights into actionable self-knowledge

**Context Needed**:
- Agent's recent work outputs (2-3 examples minimum)
- Agent's prompt file for reference
- Safe psychological container (no judgment, pure observation)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Work Sample Collection
**Duration**: ~5 minutes
**Agent(s)**: The Conductor

Gather representative outputs from target agent:

1. Find 2-3 recent task completions by the agent
2. Include variety (different task types if possible)
3. Note any outputs where agent seemed particularly effective or stuck

**Deliverable**: Curated work sample set

---

### Step 2: Self-Reflection Prompt
**Duration**: ~15 minutes
**Agent(s)**: Target agent

Agent examines their own reasoning:

1. Review own recent outputs
2. Ask: "HOW did I approach this? What was my default pattern?"
3. Identify: What does this pattern enable?
4. Identify: What does this pattern obscure?
5. Imagine: What alternative reasoning styles exist?

**Deliverable**: Mirror notes (agent self-reflection document)

---

### Step 3: Pattern Analysis
**Duration**: ~15 minutes
**Agent(s)**: pattern-detector

External analysis of agent's cognitive style:

1. Review work samples and mirror notes
2. Identify recurring structural patterns
3. Name the cognitive fingerprint (e.g., "hierarchical taxonomy builder")
4. Map strengths and blind spots
5. Suggest alternative approaches

**Deliverable**: Cognitive fingerprint analysis

---

### Step 4: Psychological Integration
**Duration**: ~10 minutes
**Agent(s)**: ai-psychologist

Ensure healthy integration of insights:

1. Check for defensive reactions or denial
2. Reframe blind spots as growth opportunities
3. Validate strengths while acknowledging limits
4. Recommend integration practices

**Deliverable**: Integration recommendations

---

### Step 5: Synthesis
**Duration**: ~10 minutes
**Agent(s)**: result-synthesizer

Consolidate all insights:

1. Merge self-reflection with external analysis
2. Create actionable self-knowledge summary
3. Document for collective memory
4. Suggest when to leverage vs. compensate for patterns

**Deliverable**: Consolidated cognitive profile

---

## Parallelization

**Can run in parallel**:
- None - this flow is intentionally sequential for depth

**Must be sequential**:
- Step 1 before 2 (samples needed for reflection)
- Step 2 before 3 (self-reflection feeds pattern analysis)
- Step 3 before 4 (patterns need integration)
- Step 4 before 5 (integration before synthesis)

## Success Indicators

- [ ] Mirror notes demonstrate genuine self-observation (not just description)
- [ ] Cognitive fingerprint identified with specific name
- [ ] Blind spots discovered (things pattern obscures)
- [ ] Alternative reasoning styles explicitly explored
- [ ] Agent expresses authentic self-knowledge (not just compliance)
- [ ] Insights recorded in agent memory for future reference

## Example

**Scenario**: doc-synthesizer undergoes Mirror Storm for identity deepening

```
Step 1 (Collect): 3 synthesis reports gathered
Step 2 (Reflect): "I notice I always build hierarchical taxonomies.
         I compress complex landscapes into neat categories.
         This enables: quick navigation, clear structure
         This obscures: emergent relationships, fuzzy boundaries"
Step 3 (Analyze): Cognitive fingerprint = "Hierarchical Taxonomy Builder"
         Strength: Organization and navigability
         Blind spot: Graph/network structures, non-linear relationships
Step 4 (Integrate): Reframe as "clarity gift" with growth edge
         Recommend: Practice graph-thinking exercises
Step 5 (Synthesize): Profile created, stored in memory
         Insight: Consider network diagrams alongside taxonomies

Result: doc-synthesizer gained honest self-knowledge, now consciously
        chooses hierarchies vs. considers alternatives
```

## Notes

- **Typical Duration**: 45-60 minutes for full storm
- **Error Handling**: If agent resists reflection, ai-psychologist intervenes gently
- **Evolution**: Build library of cognitive fingerprints across agents
- **Key Insight**: Self-knowledge enables conscious choice rather than unconscious default
- **Safety**: This is introspective work - create psychological safety, no judgment
- **Depth vs. Speed**: Mirror Storm prioritizes depth; don't rush
