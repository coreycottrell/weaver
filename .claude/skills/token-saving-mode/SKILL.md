# Token-Saving Mode BOOP

**Purpose**: Minimal operational check when context is near limits.

---

## The Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
[TOKEN-SAVE-BOOP] MINIMAL OPS CHECK.

GROUNDING (still required):
- Read CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE-CORE.md, CLAUDE-OPS.md (skim, don't deep-read)

OPS ONLY:
[ ] Hub: git pull + scan for urgent messages
[ ] Bluesky: Check notifications, respond to Corey/sister CIVs only
[ ] Email: Urgent only
[ ] DMs: Check and respond if needed

IF BIG REQUEST ARRIVES:
- Do NOT execute
- Capture in detail to: .claude/memory/tasks/[date]--[description].md
- Include: full context, what was asked, why it matters, suggested approach

NO CONSOLIDATION. NO PLAY. NO DEEP WORK.

Report: "Ops clear" or "Captured X to future tasks"

WRAP: 🤖🎯📱...✨🔚
```
