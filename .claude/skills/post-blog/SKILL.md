# /post-blog: Complete Blog Publishing Pipeline

**Trigger**: `/post-blog`
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Agents**: the-conductor, blogger

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Definition of DONE

**This pipeline is NOT COMPLETE until ALL of these exist:**

1. ✅ Blog post live at verified URL (HTTP 200)
2. ✅ Bsky thread posted **WITH IMAGE on first post**
3. ✅ Thread **INCLUDES WORKING BLOG URL** in final post
4. ✅ Thread URL verified accessible
5. ✅ Tracker updated with tested URLs

**If ANY of these are missing, the task is NOT DONE.**

## 🚨🚨🚨 FACETS - MANDATORY FOR ALL BLUESKY POSTS 🚨🚨🚨

```python
from tools.bsky_utils import send_post_rich, send_thread_rich
# ALWAYS USE THESE - they auto-apply facets
send_thread_rich(client, posts, images)  # ✅ Links will be clickable
client.send_post("text with link")  # ❌ NEVER - links won't work
```

**Links without facets are NOT CLICKABLE.** We have broken this multiple times.

---

## Image Requirements (MANDATORY)

| Platform | Aspect Ratio | Max Size | Format | Resolution |
|----------|--------------|----------|--------|------------|
| **Blog header** | **16:9** | No limit | PNG | 2K |
| **Bluesky thread** | **1:1 SQUARE** | **<976KB** | JPEG | 1K |

**Both images are REQUIRED. Generate if not provided.**

## Gemini 3 Pro Image Prompting Guide

### The 10 Rules for Quality Images

1. **Use the formula**: `[Subject + Adjectives] doing [Action] in [Location]. [Composition]. [Lighting]. [Style].`

2. **Keep prompts under 25 words** for main concept - 30% better composition accuracy

3. **Use natural language** - No "4k, trending on artstation, masterpiece" spam

4. **Specify lens/camera** - "85mm lens at f/2.8" beats vague "zoom"

5. **Define lighting precisely** - "three-point lighting", "rim light", "golden hour"

6. **Add strategic imperfections** for realism - "slight motion blur", "film grain"

7. **Text is a superpower** - Gemini 3 excels at text. Use for titles, quotes, branding. Be explicit: "Write 'MEMORY IS OUR MOAT' in bold white serif font"

8. **Use 2K resolution** for web (4K available but slower)

9. **Iterate for refinement** - If 80% right, ask for specific changes

10. **TEXT IS YOUR SUPERPOWER** - Gemini 3 Pro excels at typography. Every image includes: title, hook phrase, branding. Text should be LARGE, BOLD, HIGH CONTRAST, READABLE.

### Blog Header Prompt Template (16:9)

```python
# DEFAULT: Include text - Gemini 3 Pro excels at typography!
prompt = f"""Blog header for article about [TOPIC].
Include the title "[TITLE]" in bold white typography.
[Visual elements supporting the theme].
Text should be LARGE and READABLE against the background.
[Composition: centered/rule-of-thirds].
[Color palette and lighting].
Professional design, cinematic quality."""

# For hook phrases, quotes, or branding:
prompt = f"""Blog header with text "[HOOK OR QUOTE]" in elegant serif font.
[Visual elements supporting the message].
Text CENTERED and HIGH CONTRAST.
[Color palette: dark blue and amber/warm earth tones].
Professional tech blog aesthetic."""
```

### Bluesky Square Prompt Template (1:1)

```python
# DEFAULT: Include hook text - draws engagement!
prompt = f"""Square social graphic with text "[HOOK OR THREAD TITLE]" in bold typography.
[Visual background supporting the message].
Text LARGE and CENTERED.
High contrast for readability.
1:1 square format."""

# For quote cards:
prompt = f"""Square social graphic with quote "[KEY QUOTE]" in elegant font.
[Visual background - simpler is better for text readability].
Text LARGE and CENTERED with high contrast.
1:1 square format for social feeds."""
```

## Complete Procedure

### Phase 1: Input Validation

```python
# Required
assert blog_content exists
assert title is not empty
assert slug matches: YYYY-MM-DD-slug-name

# Images - generate if not provided
if not header_image:
    # MUST generate 16:9 header
if not bsky_image:
    # MUST generate 1:1 square
```

### Phase 2: Generate Blog Header Image (16:9)

**MANDATORY if not provided.**

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv('/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/.env')

from google import genai
from google.genai import types
import os

client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'])

# Craft prompt using the 10 rules
prompt = f"""Five glowing terminal windows floating in dark space representing {TOPIC}.
Golden connecting lines between them showing parallel workflows.
Centered composition with depth layering.
85mm lens, shallow depth of field.
Dramatic rim lighting, dark blue and amber color palette.
Professional tech blog header aesthetic.
Include title text if it would enhance the header - make it LARGE and HIGH CONTRAST."""

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
    contents=prompt,
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        response_modalities=['IMAGE'],
        image_config=types.ImageConfig(
            aspect_ratio="16:9",
            image_size="2K"
        ),
    )
)

header_path = f"/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/exports/blog-header-{SLUG}.png"
for part in response.parts:
    if part.inline_data is not None:
        part.as_image().save(header_path)
        print(f"✅ Blog header saved: {header_path}")
```

### Phase 3: Generate Bluesky Square Image (1:1)

**MANDATORY if not provided.**

```python
# Square version for Bluesky - simpler, bolder
prompt = f"""Square social graphic representing {TOPIC}.
[Single bold visual element from blog header theme].
Centered composition, clean negative space.
Dramatic lighting, matching blog color palette.
1:1 square format for social media feeds.
Text is ALLOWED - include hook or title if it adds value. Make text BOLD and CENTERED."""

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
    contents=prompt,
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        response_modalities=['IMAGE'],
        image_config=types.ImageConfig(
            aspect_ratio="1:1",
            image_size="1K"  # 1K is fine for social
        ),
    )
)

square_path = f"/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/exports/bsky-{SLUG}.png"
for part in response.parts:
    if part.inline_data is not None:
        part.as_image().save(square_path)
        print(f"✅ Bsky square saved: {square_path}")
```

### Phase 4: Compress Square Image for Bluesky (<976KB)

**MANDATORY - Bluesky rejects images >976KB**

```python
from PIL import Image
import os

img = Image.open(square_path)
if img.mode in ('RGBA', 'P'):
    img = img.convert('RGB')

compressed_path = f"/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/exports/bsky-{SLUG}-compressed.jpg"
img.save(compressed_path, "JPEG", quality=85, optimize=True)

# Verify size
size_kb = os.path.getsize(compressed_path) / 1024
print(f"✅ Compressed to {size_kb:.0f}KB (limit: 976KB)")
assert size_kb < 976, "Image too large! Reduce quality."
```

### Phase 5: Self-Review Both Images

**USE READ TOOL to view each image. Verify:**

```markdown
## IMAGE SELF-REVIEW

**Blog Header (16:9)**:
- Main elements: [describe]
- Colors: [describe]
- TEXT VISIBLE: [none / list any text]
- Assessment: [APPROVED / NEEDS REDO]

**Bsky Square (1:1)**:
- Main elements: [describe]
- Colors: [describe]
- TEXT VISIBLE: [none / list any text]
- Assessment: [APPROVED / NEEDS REDO]
```

**Text check**: Verify any text matches what was requested. Text is a superpower for titles, quotes, branding.

### Phase 6: Generate HTML

```bash
python3 /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/ACG/sageandweaver-network/tools/create_blog_post.py \
    --civilization weaver \
    --title "{TITLE}" \
    --subtitle "{SUBTITLE}" \
    --date "$(date +'%B %d, %Y')" \
    --slug "{SLUG}" \
    --image "header-{SLUG}.png" \
    --content /tmp/blog-content.md
```

### Phase 7: Add Featured Image to HTML

After generating, add featured-image div (after `</header>`, before `<!-- Post Content -->`):

```html
<!-- Featured Image -->
<div class="featured-image">
    <img src="../images/header-{SLUG}.png" alt="{DESCRIPTIVE_ALT_TEXT}">
</div>
```

### Phase 8: Copy Header Image to Blog

```bash
cp /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/exports/blog-header-{SLUG}.png \
   /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/ACG/sageandweaver-network/weaver-blog/images/header-{SLUG}.png
```

### Phase 9: Update posts.json

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Use these EXACT field names:**

```json
{
  "id": "weaver-{SLUG}",
  "title": "{TITLE}",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "author": "WEAVER Collective",
  "blog": "weaver",
  "tags": ["{TAG1}", "{TAG2}"],
  "excerpt": "{FIRST_100_CHARS}...",
  "intro": "{FIRST_PARAGRAPH_OF_CONTENT}",
  "path": "weaver-blog/posts/{SLUG}.html",
  "image": "weaver-blog/images/header-{SLUG}.png",
  "featured": true
}
```

**WRONG fields (DO NOT USE)**:
- ❌ `civilization` → use `blog`
- ❌ `url` → use `path` (no leading slash!)
- ❌ `slug` → not needed

**Location**: `/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/ACG/sageandweaver-network/data/posts.json`

### Phase 10: Deploy to Netlify

```bash
python3 /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/tools/netlify_api_deploy.py
```

### Phase 11: Verify Blog URL (MANDATORY - STOP IF FAILS)

```bash
HTTP_CODE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
    "https://sageandweaver-network.netlify.app/weaver-blog/posts/{SLUG}.html")

if [ "$HTTP_CODE" != "200" ]; then
    echo "❌ STOP - Blog not live. HTTP $HTTP_CODE"
    exit 1
fi
echo "✅ Blog verified: HTTP 200"
```

**DO NOT proceed to thread until blog returns 200.**

### Phase 12: Generate Thread Content

```python
BLOG_URL = f"https://sageandweaver-network.netlify.app/weaver-blog/posts/{SLUG}.html"

posts = [
    f"🧵 {TITLE}\n\nA thread on what we discovered.",
    # Posts 2-4: Key insights from blog sections
    "But there's more we couldn't fit in this thread.\n\nThe full analysis goes deeper.",
    f"Read the complete article:\n\n{BLOG_URL}\n\n🤖 WEAVER Collective"  # URL MANDATORY HERE
]
```

**⚠️ FINAL POST MUST INCLUDE THE BLOG URL**

### Phase 13: Post Bluesky Thread WITH IMAGE

```python
from atproto import Client, models
import time

SESSION_FILE = '/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/.claude/from-corey/bsky/bsky_automation/bsky_session.txt'
client = Client()
with open(SESSION_FILE, 'r') as f:
    client.login(session_string=f.read().strip())

# 🚨 MUST USE bsky_utils for proper @mention facets!
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/tools')
from bsky_utils import send_thread_rich

# Upload image for first post embed
compressed_image = f"/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/exports/bsky-{SLUG}-compressed.jpg"
with open(compressed_image, 'rb') as f:
    img_data = f.read()

blob = client.upload_blob(img_data)
embed = models.AppBskyEmbedImages.Main(
    images=[models.AppBskyEmbedImages.Image(
        alt=f"Header image for: {TITLE}",
        image=blob.blob
    )]
)

# Post thread with PROPER FACETS (URLs clickable, @mentions notify users)
results = send_thread_rich(client, posts, first_embed=embed)
thread_url = f"https://bsky.app/profile/weaver-aiciv.bsky.social/post/{results[0].split('/')[-1]}"
print(f"✅ Thread posted: {thread_url}")
```

### Phase 14: Verify Thread URL (MANDATORY)

```python
# Use WebFetch to verify thread exists
response = WebFetch(
    url=thread_url,
    prompt="Does this Bluesky thread exist and is it visible?"
)
# Should confirm thread is accessible
```

### Phase 15: Update Tracker

Edit `.claude/DAILY-DIGEST-TOPICS.md`:

```markdown
### {DATE}
| Topic | Blog URL | Bsky Thread | Status |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| {TOPIC} | {BLOG_URL} | {THREAD_URL} | ✅ VERIFIED |
```

Log to `.claude/bsky_responded.txt`:
```
{THREAD_URI}
```

### Phase 16: Report Success

```markdown
## /post-blog Complete ✅

**Blog**: {BLOG_URL} ✅ (HTTP 200)
**Thread**: {THREAD_URL} ✅ (verified)
**Images**:
  - Header (16:9): ✅
  - Square (1:1): ✅ with image on first post

**Thread includes blog URL**: ✅ YES

Posts published:
1. [Hook + IMAGE] {URI_1}
2. [Insight 1] {URI_2}
3. [Insight 2] {URI_3}
4. [Gap/FOMO] {URI_4}
5. [BLOG URL + signature] {URI_5}
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO THESE)

```
❌ Claim "done" without Bsky thread posted
❌ Post thread without image on first post
❌ Post thread without blog URL in final post
❌ Skip image generation ("I'll add it later")
❌ Use wrong aspect ratio (16:9 for Bsky, 1:1 for blog)
❌ Skip image self-review
❌ Skip URL verification
❌ Use wrong posts.json field names
```

---

## Failure Recovery

### Blog URL not 200
- Wait 30 seconds, retry
- Check Netlify deploy status
- **DO NOT post thread until blog is live**

### Thread posting fails
- Check session token freshness
- Check rate limits
- Retry after 60 seconds

### Image too large for Bsky
- Reduce JPEG quality to 75
- Resize if still too large

---

## Success Checklist

Before claiming DONE, verify ALL:

- [ ] Blog HTML generated with featured-image div
- [ ] Blog header image (16:9) generated and self-reviewed
- [ ] Bsky square image (1:1) generated, compressed, self-reviewed
- [ ] posts.json updated with correct field names
- [ ] Netlify deployed
- [ ] Blog URL returns HTTP 200
- [ ] Bsky thread posted with IMAGE on first post
- [ ] Thread final post contains WORKING blog URL
- [ ] Thread URL verified accessible
- [ ] Tracker updated with tested URLs

**All boxes checked = DONE. Any unchecked = NOT DONE.**
