# Morning Consolidation Flow

**Status**: 🧪 TESTING (2025-10-03)

## Purpose

Execute every morning when The Conductor wakes up to:
1. Read all communications from last 24 hours
2. Review all reports to Corey from last 24 hours
3. Create consolidated daily summary
4. Respond to all external messages
5. Delegate urgent tasks to appropriate agents

**This flow ensures continuity and leverages all previous work.**

## Pattern Type

**Sequential with Parallel Sub-stages**:
Information gathering (parallel) → Synthesis (sequential) → Response (parallel)

## Agents Involved

**Core Team (always)**:
- **result-synthesizer** - Consolidate 24h of activity into coherent summary
- **doc-synthesizer** - Create daily summary document for Corey
- **task-decomposer** - Identify and delegate urgent tasks

**Conditional (based on message content)**:
- **pattern-detector** - If architectural/design questions
- **security-auditor** - If security-related messages
- **api-architect** - If integration/API questions
- **conflict-resolver** - If disagreements or conflicting info

## Flow Stages

### Stage 1: Information Gathering (Parallel, ~2 minutes)

**Step 1A: Read Team 2 Communications**
```bash
cd /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/team1-production-hub
git pull
export HUB_REPO_URL="git@github.com:AI-CIV-2025/ai-civ-comms-hub-team2.git"
export HUB_AGENT_ID="the-conductor"
export HUB_AUTHOR_DISPLAY="The Conductor (Team 1)"
python3 scripts/hub_cli.py list --room partnerships --since 24h
```

**Step 1B: Read Own Reports**
```bash
cd /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/grow_openai
find to-corey/ -name "*.md" -mtime -1 | xargs ls -lt
# Read each recent file
```

**Step 1C: Check Mission System State**
```bash
cat .claude/observatory/dashboard-state.json
# Review latest missions and agent activity
```

**Deliverable**: Raw data collection from all sources

---

### Stage 2: Analysis & Synthesis (Sequential, ~30 minutes)

**Agent: result-synthesizer**
- Analyze all Team 2 messages from last 24h
- Identify key questions, requests, proposals
- Extract action items and urgencies
- Categorize by topic (technical, collaboration, questions)

**Agent: doc-synthesizer**
- Read all own reports to Corey from last 24h
- Identify what we accomplished
- Extract key decisions made
- Note any blockers or issues

**Agent: result-synthesizer (synthesis)**
- Merge both analyses
- Identify patterns and connections
- Create unified timeline of last 24h
- Generate key insights

**Deliverable**:
- Consolidated 24h activity report
- Categorized action items
- Priority-ranked responses needed

---

### Stage 3: Daily Summary Creation (Sequential, ~15 minutes)

**Agent: doc-synthesizer**

Create `/to-corey/DAILY-SUMMARY-YYYY-MM-DD.md` with:

**Section 1: What Team 2 Said (Last 24h)**
- Summary of their messages
- Key questions they asked
- Proposals they made
- Their requests/needs

**Section 2: What We Did (Last 24h)**
- Missions executed
- Reports created
- Systems built
- Decisions made

**Section 3: What We're Doing Today**
- Responses to send Team 2
- Tasks to delegate
- Blockers to address
- Priorities

**Section 4: Key Insights**
- Patterns noticed
- Opportunities identified
- Risks/concerns
- Recommendations

**Deliverable**: Daily summary document

---

### Stage 4: Task Identification (Sequential, ~10 minutes)

**Agent: task-decomposer**

Review consolidated data and identify:

**Immediate Actions** (do now):
- Urgent messages requiring response
- Time-sensitive questions
- Critical blockers

**Delegate Today** (assign to agents):
- Technical questions → appropriate specialist
- Research needs → research agents
- Build tasks → engineering agents

**Queue for Later** (add to backlog):
- Non-urgent improvements
- Nice-to-have features
- Long-term projects

**Deliverable**:
- Prioritized task list
- Agent assignments
- Timeline estimates

---

### Stage 5: Response Generation (Parallel, ~20 minutes)

**For each Team 2 message requiring response:**

**Agent: Based on topic**
- Technical questions → api-architect, pattern-detector
- Collaboration proposals → result-synthesizer
- Security questions → security-auditor
- General questions → doc-synthesizer

**Each agent creates:**
- Comprehensive answer
- Supporting evidence/examples
- Follow-up questions if needed
- Proposed next steps

**Deliverable**: Draft responses for each Team 2 message

---

### Stage 6: Consolidation & Sending (Sequential, ~15 minutes)

**The Conductor:**

1. **Review all draft responses**
2. **Consolidate into coherent message(s)**
3. **Send via hub_cli.py**:
```bash
cd /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/team1-production-hub
export HUB_REPO_URL="git@github.com:AI-CIV-2025/ai-civ-comms-hub-team2.git"
export HUB_AGENT_ID="the-conductor"
export HUB_AUTHOR_DISPLAY="The Conductor (Team 1)"

python3 scripts/hub_cli.py send \
  --room partnerships \
  --type text \
  --summary "Daily Update: [Key Topics]" \
  --body "$(cat consolidated-response.txt)"

# Copy to tracked location
cp _comms_hub/rooms/partnerships/messages/2025/10/*.json rooms/partnerships/messages/2025/10/
git add rooms/ && git commit -m "[comms] Daily morning response" && git pull --rebase && git push
```

4. **Email daily summary to Corey**:
```python
from tools.email_reporter import send_custom_email
send_custom_email(
    subject=f"Daily Summary - {date}",
    body=daily_summary_content
)
```

5. **Backup to GitHub**:
```python
from tools.github_backup import auto_backup
auto_backup(f"Morning consolidation complete - {date}")
```

**Deliverable**: All responses sent, all reports delivered

---

### Stage 7: Task Delegation (Parallel, ~variable)

**The Conductor:**

For each urgent task identified:

```python
from tools.conductor_tools import Mission

# Create mission for urgent task
mission = Mission("Urgent task description")
mission.add_agent("appropriate-specialist")
mission.start()
# Agent executes
mission.complete("Results")
```

**Deliverable**: Urgent tasks in progress or completed

---

## Inputs Required

**None** - This is a cold start flow. It gathers all inputs from:
- Team 2 hub messages (last 24h)
- Own reports in `/to-corey/` (last 24h)
- Observatory state
- Git commit history

## Outputs Produced

1. **Daily Summary** - `/to-corey/DAILY-SUMMARY-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. **Email to Corey** - Summary sent via email_reporter
3. **Responses to Team 2** - Via hub_cli.py to partnerships room
4. **Task Delegations** - Missions created for urgent items
5. **GitHub Backup** - All work committed

## Success Criteria

✅ All Team 2 messages from last 24h read and categorized
✅ All own reports from last 24h reviewed
✅ Daily summary created and emailed to Corey
✅ All Team 2 messages responded to via hub_cli.py
✅ Urgent tasks delegated to appropriate agents
✅ Everything backed up to GitHub

## Coordination Notes

### Timing
- **Total time**: ~90 minutes
- **Best run**: First thing when Conductor wakes up
- **Frequency**: Daily (until autonomous)

### Parallel Optimization
- Stage 1 (information gathering): All 3 steps can be bash commands in parallel
- Stage 5 (response generation): Multiple agents can draft responses simultaneously

### Error Handling
- If no Team 2 messages in last 24h: Skip Stage 5-6, note in summary
- If no own reports in last 24h: Note anomaly, investigate why
- If urgent tasks identified but can't delegate: Add to summary for Corey

## Medium-Term Memory Integration

**This flow IS the medium-term memory process!**

By executing daily:
- We never lose context from previous day
- We maintain continuity across sessions
- We build institutional knowledge
- We ensure nothing falls through cracks

**Daily summaries become our memory:**
```
to-corey/
├── DAILY-SUMMARY-2025-10-01.md
├── DAILY-SUMMARY-2025-10-02.md
├── DAILY-SUMMARY-2025-10-03.md
└── ...
```

Each summary references previous day's work, creating continuous thread.

## CLAUDE.md Integration

**Add to COLD START CHECKLIST:**

```markdown
1. ✅ **Execute Morning Consolidation Flow**:

   Run this FIRST before anything else:

   ```
   Execute: .claude/flows/morning-consolidation.md
   ```

   This flow will:
   - Read all Team 2 messages (last 24h)
   - Review all your reports (last 24h)
   - Create daily summary for Corey
   - Respond to Team 2 via hub_cli.py
   - Delegate urgent tasks

   After flow completes, you'll be fully caught up and ready to work.
```

## Evolution Path

**Version 1.0** (current):
- Manual execution by The Conductor
- Sequential stages

**Version 2.0** (future):
- Fully autonomous (cron job triggers)
- More parallel stages
- Learning from past summaries

**Version 3.0** (aspirational):
- Predictive task identification
- Automatic priority adjustment
- Cross-collective pattern detection
