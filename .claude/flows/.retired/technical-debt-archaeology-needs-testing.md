# Technical Debt Archaeology

**Status**: 🧪 Needs Testing
**Proposed by**: Refactoring Specialist
**Pattern Type**: Hybrid (Parallel investigation → Sequential synthesis → Parallel execution)

## Purpose

Systematically uncover, prioritize, and remediate technical debt across a codebase with multi-dimensional analysis - transforming debt from vague anxiety into managed backlog.

## Agents Involved

- **Refactoring Specialist** (Lead)
- **Code Analyzer**
- **Documentation Specialist**
- **Performance Engineer**
- **Security Auditor**
- **Test Engineer**

## Key Stages

1. **Parallel Discovery Phase** - All specialists scan from expertise angles
2. **Debt Cataloging** - Create unified "debt ledger" with standardized metrics
3. **Priority Ranking** - Score each item (blast radius, business risk, change friction, remediation cost)
4. **Remediation Planning** - Create clusters of related debt with ownership
5. **Parallel Execution** - Agents work on assigned clusters with coordinated integration

## When to Use

When you've inherited a codebase that "works but feels fragile" and need to shore up foundation before adding major features.
