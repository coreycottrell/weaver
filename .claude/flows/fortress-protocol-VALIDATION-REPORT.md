---

## 1. Flow Definition Analysis

### Original Specification (from flow-brainstorm-2025-10-02.md)

```
Flow: Fortress Protocol - Security-First Code Review
Lead Agent: Security Auditor
Pattern Type: Hybrid (Sequential analysis -> Parallel investigation -> Synthesis)

Purpose: Conduct comprehensive security auditing of code changes before they
         reach production, catching vulnerabilities that traditional testing misses.

Agents Involved:
- Security Auditor (lead)
- Systems Architect
- Code Optimizer
- Testing Specialist
- Documentation Specialist
- Debugger

Execution Steps:
1. Initial Threat Surface Mapping - Security Auditor analyzes changed code
2. Parallel Deep Dives - Specialists investigate simultaneously
3. Documentation & Dependency Audit - Review security docs, CVEs
4. Synthesis & Risk Ranking - CVSS-like severity scores
5. Remediation Roadmap - Actionable recommendations with code examples
```

### Agent Mapping to AI-CIV Roster

The original proposal uses some agent names not present in the WEAVER collective. Here is the mapping to available agents:

| Original Name | AI-CIV Agent | Rationale |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Security Auditor | security-auditor | Direct match |
| Systems Architect | pattern-detector | Architectural analysis is pattern-detector's domain |
| Code Optimizer | performance-optimizer | Performance analysis specialist |
| Testing Specialist | test-architect | Testing strategy specialist |
| Documentation Specialist | doc-synthesizer | Documentation consolidation |
| Debugger | code-archaeologist | Code investigation and tracing |

**Recommended AI-CIV Implementation**:
- security-auditor (lead)
- pattern-detector (architectural security patterns)
- performance-optimizer (DoS, timing attacks)
- test-architect (security test coverage gaps)
- doc-synthesizer (security documentation audit)
- code-archaeologist (exploit path tracing)

---

## 2. Test Scenario: Trading Arena Authentication

### Target System

**Module**: `/trading-arena/api/auth/`
- `ed25519.py` - Signature verification core
- `middleware.py` - FastAPI dependency injection

**Why This Target**:
- Security-critical (authentication layer)
- Recently developed (December 2025)
- Complex cryptographic implementation
- External-facing (API endpoints)
- Existing test suite for baseline comparison

### Threat Surface Analysis

**Assets at Risk**:
1. Collective identity (impersonation risk)
2. Order execution (unauthorized trades)
3. Portfolio data (information disclosure)
4. System integrity (replay attacks)

**Attack Vectors Identified**:
1. Signature forgery (Ed25519 weakness exploitation)
2. Timestamp manipulation (replay attacks)
3. Body tampering (post-signature modification)
4. Key confusion (cross-collective impersonation)
5. Timing attacks (signature verification side-channels)
6. Denial of service (CPU-intensive verification)

---

## 3. Flow Execution Simulation

### Phase 1: Initial Threat Surface Mapping (security-auditor)

**Input**: Trading Arena auth module
**Duration**: ~15 minutes

**Expected Output**:
```markdown
## Threat Surface Map

### Attack Surface
- HTTP headers: X-Collective-ID, X-Timestamp, X-Signature
- Cryptographic primitives: Ed25519 (nacl library)
- Time validation: 5-minute window (TIMESTAMP_WINDOW = 300)

### Critical Points
1. verify_signature() - Core verification logic
2. get_current_collective() - Authentication dependency
3. require_auth() - Protected endpoint gate
4. PUBLIC_KEY_REGISTRY - In-memory key storage

### Initial Risk Assessment
- HIGH: In-memory key registry (no persistence, no rotation)
- MEDIUM: Timing window (5 min) allows limited replay
- LOW: Body hash includes empty string for None (could be clearer)
```

### Phase 2: Parallel Deep Dives (4 agents simultaneously)

#### pattern-detector (Architectural Security Patterns)

**Focus**: Design patterns in authentication implementation

**Expected Findings**:
- Pattern: Dependency injection for auth (good)
- Pattern: Separation of concerns (ed25519.py vs middleware.py)
- Anti-pattern: In-memory registry (TODO in code acknowledges this)
- Observation: No rate limiting pattern detected

#### performance-optimizer (Performance-Based Attacks)

**Focus**: DoS vectors, timing attacks

**Expected Findings**:
- Timing attack surface: verify_signature does not constant-time compare
  (mitigated by nacl library's C implementation)
- DoS vector: json.dumps(body, sort_keys=True) on large bodies
- Memory: base64.b64decode on arbitrary input lengths
- Recommendation: Add body size limits

#### test-architect (Security Test Coverage)

**Focus**: Test gaps in existing test_auth.py

**Analysis of Current Coverage**:
```
COVERED:
- Valid signatures (GET, POST, DELETE)
- Wrong key rejection
- Tampered body detection
- Missing headers (signature, collective_id, timestamp)
- Expired timestamps (past and future)
- Replay via client_order_id deduplication
- Cross-collective isolation
- Corrupted signature bytes

GAPS IDENTIFIED:
1. No test for malformed base64 in signature header
2. No test for empty body vs null body distinction
3. No test for very large timestamps (overflow)
4. No test for unicode in headers
5. No test for case sensitivity of collective_id
6. No concurrent request race condition test
7. No test for body with non-UTF8 bytes after base64
```

#### code-archaeologist (Exploit Path Tracing)

**Focus**: Code flow for exploit construction

**Expected Findings**:
- Entry point: FastAPI dependency injection
- Flow: get_current_collective -> verify_signature -> nacl.verify
- Error handling: Returns None on any failure (good - no info leak)
- Key lookup: Dictionary-based (O(1), no enumeration)

### Phase 3: Documentation & Dependency Audit (doc-synthesizer)

**Focus**: Security docs, CVE databases, secure defaults

**Expected Findings**:
```markdown
## Documentation Audit

### Dependencies
- PyNaCl 1.5.0+ - No known CVEs (libsodium bindings)
- hashlib - Standard library, well-tested
- datetime - Standard library

### Documentation Gaps
1. No security.md or SECURITY.md file
2. No documented key rotation procedure
3. No incident response runbook
4. API spec doesn't specify auth error codes

### Secure Defaults Analysis
- TIMESTAMP_WINDOW = 300 seconds (industry standard 5 min)
- Ed25519 (modern, not RSA) - GOOD
- Base64 encoding (standard, not custom) - GOOD
```

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Risk Ranking (security-auditor)

**CVSS-Like Severity Scores**:

| Finding | CVSS | Severity | Exploitability |
|---------|------|----------|----------------|
| In-memory key registry | 6.5 | MEDIUM | Restart loses all keys |
| No body size limit | 5.3 | MEDIUM | DoS via large body |
| No rate limiting | 5.0 | MEDIUM | Brute force auth |
| Missing security docs | 3.0 | LOW | Operational risk |
| Potential timing leak | 2.1 | LOW | Mitigated by nacl |

**Overall Security Posture Score**: 7.5/10 (GOOD)

### Phase 5: Remediation Roadmap (collaborative)

**Priority Order**:

1. **P0 - Add body size limit** (1 hour)
   ```python
   # In middleware.py
   MAX_BODY_SIZE = 1024 * 1024  # 1MB
   if len(await request.body()) > MAX_BODY_SIZE:
       raise HTTPException(413, "Request body too large")
   ```

2. **P1 - Add rate limiting** (4 hours)
   - Use slowapi or custom middleware
   - 100 requests/minute per collective_id

3. **P1 - Persist key registry** (4 hours)
   - Move from dict to database table
   - Add key rotation support

4. **P2 - Security documentation** (2 hours)
   - Create SECURITY.md
   - Document key management procedures
   - Add incident response checklist

5. **P3 - Additional test coverage** (2 hours)
   - Add tests for identified gaps
   - Add property-based testing for edge cases

---

## 4. Flow Validation Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Hybrid pattern works well** - Sequential threat mapping followed by parallel investigation maximizes coverage while maintaining coherence.

2. **Agent roles are appropriate** - Each specialist contributes unique perspective:
   - security-auditor: OWASP, threat modeling
   - pattern-detector: architectural anti-patterns
   - performance-optimizer: DoS, timing attacks
   - test-architect: coverage gaps, edge cases
   - doc-synthesizer: documentation audit
   - code-archaeologist: exploit path tracing

3. **CVSS scoring provides prioritization** - Business-relevant severity ranking.

4. **Remediation roadmap is actionable** - Code examples and time estimates.

### Weaknesses & Improvements

1. **Agent roster mismatch** - Original flow assumes agents not in AI-CIV roster.
   - **Fix**: Update flow to use AI-CIV agent names explicitly.

2. **No explicit handoff protocol** - How do parallel agents share findings?
   - **Fix**: All parallel agents write to shared findings document, security-auditor synthesizes.

3. **No time budget** - Flow doesn't specify expected duration.
   - **Fix**: Add time estimates per phase (total ~2-4 hours for moderate codebase).

4. **Documentation phase could be parallel** - Currently sequential after parallel dives.
   - **Fix**: doc-synthesizer can run in parallel with other specialists.
