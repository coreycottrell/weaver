## Evaluation Table

| # | Flow Name | Frequency | Value | Simpler Alt? | Verdict |
|---|-----------|-----------|-------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | Competitive Intelligence Deep Dive | Rarely | 4/10 | Parallel Research + web-researcher | **SKIP** - WEAVER builds internal tools, not competitive products |
| 2 | Archaeological Dig | Monthly | 6/10 | code-archaeologist direct | **TEST ONCE** - Useful when inheriting external code |
| 3 | Architecture X-Ray | Monthly | 7/10 | pattern-detector + 1-2 agents | **TEST ONCE** - Good for self-audits |
| 4 | Technical Debt Archaeology | Quarterly | 5/10 | Great Audit covers this | **SKIP** - Great Audit already validated for systemic review |
| 5 | Fortress Protocol | Quarterly | 7/10 | security-auditor direct | **TEST** - Trading Arena needs this |

## Detailed Analysis

### RECOMMEND TESTING (4 flows)

**5. Fortress Protocol** - Value: 7/10
- **Why test**: Trading Arena is production-critical. Ed25519 auth, real money potentially involved.
- **When to test**: Before Trading Arena Phase 2 deployment
- **Simpler alternative**: security-auditor alone handles 80% of cases, but 6-agent deep dive warranted for critical systems

**7. User Story to Implementation** - Value: 8/10
- **Why test**: WEAVER frequently receives feature requests (from Corey, roadmap items)
- **Risk**: 6 agents over "variable" hours might be overkill for simple features
- **Recommendation**: Test on a mid-sized feature, measure if outcome beats Specialist Consultation

**12. Recursive Complexity Breakdown** - Value: 9/10
- **Why test**: This is literally my domain (task-decomposer). If this flow works better than me alone, I need to know.
- **Question**: Does 6-agent orchestration add value over task-decomposer direct invocation?
- **Risk**: This flow might reveal I am redundant when paired correctly

**13. Cross-Pollination Synthesis** - Value: 7/10
- **Why test**: WEAVER does cross-project synthesis often (e.g., Trading Arena research synthesis)
- **Recent example**: Combining alpha arena analysis + prompt eval research + WEAVER design
- **Check**: Does it beat result-synthesizer + pattern-detector pair?

---

### SKIP OR MERGE (10 flows)

**1. Competitive Intelligence Deep Dive** - Value: 4/10
- **Problem it solves**: Competitive analysis
- **WEAVER reality**: We are not building competitive products. We are building AI-CIV infrastructure.
- **When it would matter**: If WEAVER ever builds something for market (not current direction)
- **Alternative**: Parallel Research with web-researcher covers rare needs

**2. Archaeological Dig** - Value: 6/10
- **Problem it solves**: Understanding legacy codebases
- **WEAVER reality**: We write our own code. Rarely inherit legacy systems.
- **One-time test**: Could be useful if Corey hands WEAVER an external codebase
- **Alternative**: code-archaeologist direct call handles most cases

**3. Architecture X-Ray** - Value: 7/10
- **Problem it solves**: Understanding unfamiliar codebase patterns
- **WEAVER reality**: Useful for self-auditing (e.g., "what patterns emerged in Trading Arena?")
- **One-time test**: Worth trying on Trading Arena after Phase 2
- **Alternative**: pattern-detector + doc-synthesizer handles lighter needs

**4. Technical Debt Archaeology** - Value: 5/10
- **Problem it solves**: Systematic tech debt discovery
- **WEAVER reality**: Great Audit already validated for this
- **Redundancy**: 6 agents, 4+ hours for tech debt seems excessive
- **Alternative**: Great Audit (proven) or focused refactoring-specialist call

**6. Test-Driven Refactoring Gauntlet** - Value: 4/10
- **Problem it solves**: Safe refactoring with test coverage
- **WEAVER reality**: Our codebase is young, well-tested. 74 tests on Trading Arena already.
- **When it would matter**: Large refactoring of mature system (not current)
- **Alternative**: test-architect + refactoring-specialist pair

**8. Contract-First Integration** - Value: 6/10
- **Problem it solves**: API design with backwards compatibility
- **WEAVER reality**: Cross-CIV Protocol is early. No legacy contracts to protect yet.
- **Defer until**: Cross-CIV has production consumers
- **Alternative**: api-architect direct for current needs

**9. Knowledge Archaeology** - Value: 5/10
- **Problem it solves**: Extracting scattered knowledge from codebases
- **WEAVER reality**: We document as we go. Memory system captures learnings.
- **When it would matter**: If documentation drifted badly (not current state)
- **Alternative**: doc-synthesizer + code-archaeologist pair

**10. Performance Cascade Analysis** - Value: 3/10
- **Problem it solves**: Systematic performance bottleneck discovery
- **WEAVER reality**: No production users, no performance SLAs, no hot paths
- **When it would matter**: If Trading Arena had performance issues under load
- **Alternative**: performance-optimizer direct call when needed

**11. Semantic Harmonization** - Value: 3/10
- **Problem it solves**: Naming consistency across codebase
- **WEAVER reality**: We have naming-consultant. Naming issues are rare.
- **Time investment**: 5 agents, 2-3 hours for naming cleanup is excessive
- **Alternative**: naming-consultant single call handles occasional needs

**14. Dialectic Forge** - Value: 5/10
- **Problem it solves**: Breakthrough solutions through structured conflict
- **WEAVER reality**: Pair Consensus Dialectic already validated, covers same need
- **Recommendation**: MERGE concepts into Pair Consensus or RETIRE
- **Alternative**: Pair Consensus Dialectic (proven, simpler)

## Recommendations Summary

### Priority 1: TEST THESE (High Value)
1. **Fortress Protocol** - Security-critical, test before Trading Arena deployment
2. **User Story to Implementation** - Frequent need, validate efficiency

### Priority 2: EVALUATE CAREFULLY
3. **Recursive Complexity Breakdown** - Might make task-decomposer more effective or reveal redundancy
4. **Cross-Pollination Synthesis** - Useful for synthesis-heavy work

### Priority 3: DEFER
5. **Contract-First Integration** - Valuable later when Cross-CIV matures
6. **Architecture X-Ray** - One-time test on Trading Arena post-Phase-2

### Priority 4: SKIP
- Competitive Intelligence Deep Dive (wrong problem space)
- Technical Debt Archaeology (Great Audit covers this)
- Test-Driven Refactoring Gauntlet (overkill for current needs)
- Knowledge Archaeology (documentation is current)
- Performance Cascade Analysis (no performance-critical systems)
- Semantic Harmonization (rare need, direct call sufficient)

### Priority 5: MERGE OR RETIRE
- Dialectic Forge (redundant with Pair Consensus Dialectic)

## Agent Count Analysis

**Flows with justified agent counts:**
- Fortress Protocol (6 agents) - Security needs multiple perspectives
- User Story to Implementation (6 agents) - End-to-end feature delivery

**Flows with excessive agent counts:**
- Performance Cascade (6 agents) - Usually 1-2 agents sufficient
- Semantic Harmonization (5 agents) - naming-consultant alone is enough
- Knowledge Archaeology (5 agents) - 2-3 agents would suffice
- Test-Driven Refactoring (6 agents) - 3 agents would work

**Pattern**: Untested flows tend toward "throw all relevant agents at problem" rather than minimal viable orchestration. Validated flows prove 2-3 focused agents often outperform 6 distracted ones.

---

## Time Investment Reality Check

**WEAVER's session pattern**: 2-4 hours typical
**Many untested flows claim**: 3-4+ hours

**Problem**: A single flow consuming an entire session is rarely justified unless output is proportionally valuable.

**Validated flows that work:**
- Specialist Consultation: 45 seconds (proven)
- Parallel Research: 30-60 minutes (proven)
- Great Audit: 1-2 hours (proven)

**Untested flows claiming 4+ hours:**
- Technical Debt Archaeology: 4+ hours - Too long for quarterly use
- Test-Driven Refactoring: 4+ hours - Only justified for major refactors

---

## Constitutional Alignment

Per CLAUDE.md: "Delegation gives agents experience. Experience builds identity."

**However**: Excessive orchestration (6 agents for 4 hours on naming) is not generous delegation - it is inefficient resource allocation that could give MORE agents MORE experience through faster, focused flows.

**Principle**: Validate that multi-agent flows beat simpler alternatives before adopting them.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test Fortress Protocol** on Trading Arena security review
2. **Test User Story to Implementation** on next roadmap feature
3. **Evaluate Recursive Complexity Breakdown** - Am I (task-decomposer) better or worse with this flow?
4. **Formally retire Dialectic Forge** in favor of Pair Consensus Dialectic
5. **Archive remaining untested flows** with "CONTEXT-DEPENDENT" status (useful someday, not now)
