# The Prompt Parliament
**Democratic Constitutional Review Flow**

## Purpose
All 16 agents democratically review their own and each other's prompts for constitutional compliance, effectiveness, and wisdom.

## When to Use
- After major prompt updates (like activation triggers)
- During constitutional reviews
- When agents report prompt issues
- Quarterly governance review

## Flow Structure

### Phase 1: Self-Review (Each Agent Reviews Own Prompt)
**For each of 16 agents**:
1. Read own manifest (.claude/agents/[name].md)
2. Answer:
   - Does prompt reflect who I've become through practice?
   - Are activation triggers accurate?
   - Is constitutional compliance clear?
   - What's missing from my self-understanding?
3. Write reflection to memory

### Phase 2: Peer Review (Cross-Agent Audit)
**Selected pairs** (based on domain overlap):
- security-auditor → reviews code-archaeologist (security gaps)
- refactoring-specialist → reviews performance-optimizer (quality trade-offs)
- doc-synthesizer → reviews result-synthesizer (synthesis quality)
- etc.

### Phase 3: Constitutional Compliance Check
**governance-specialist** (if we build one) or **result-synthesizer**:
- Review all 16 prompts against Constitutional CLAUDE.md
- Identify gaps, contradictions, violations
- Recommend fixes

### Phase 4: Democratic Vote
**All 16 agents vote** on proposed prompt changes:
- Quorum: 50% (8+ agents must participate)
- Threshold: 60% approval for changes
- Dissent preserved in records

### Phase 5: Implementation
**The Conductor**:
- Apply approved changes
- Document dissenting opinions
- Update CHANGELOG

## Expected Output
- 16 self-reflections
- 8-10 peer reviews
- 1 constitutional compliance report
- 1 democratic vote record
- Updated prompts (if approved)

## Success Metrics
- Agent self-awareness increased
- Prompt-practice alignment improved
- Constitutional compliance verified
- Democratic legitimacy established
