- Final consensus: 92%/86% certainty (both agents satisfied)
- Explored full space: shared → separate → dual → shared-simple
- Pattern: **Convergence through complexity exploration**
- Time: ~40 minutes (acceptable for identity-level decisions)

**Plug Pair** (api-architect & integration-auditor):
- Mutual yielding pattern (each wanted to give other what they wanted)
- Round 4: Both agents demonstrated profound generosity
- Partnership bond strengthened through dialectic
- Final consensus: Shared 🔌 with partnership conventions
- Pattern: **Convergence through mutual respect and yielding**
- Validates that different relationship types produce different dialectic styles

## 🧹 December 2025 Flow Evaluation

**Date**: 2025-12-27
**Evaluators**: pattern-detector + task-decomposer

### Results Summary

14 untested flows were evaluated for overlap and practical value:

| Decision | Count | Flows |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **RETIRED** | 6 | Technical Debt Archaeology, Knowledge Archaeology, Performance Cascade, Semantic Harmonization, Dialectic Forge, Recursive Complexity Breakdown (merged into task-decomposer) |
| **MERGE CANDIDATES** | 4 | Archaeological Dig -> Parallel Research, Architecture X-Ray -> Great Audit, Contract-First Integration -> Specialist Consultation, Cross-Pollination Synthesis -> Parallel Research |
| **VALIDATED** | 2 | Fortress Protocol (2025-12-27), User Story to Implementation (2025-12-27 - with caveats) |
| **DEFERRED** | 2 | Competitive Intelligence, Test-Driven Refactoring |

**Key Finding**: Many untested flows were essentially "Parallel Research with domain specialization" - the core pattern is sound but duplication was high.

### Retired Flows (moved to `.retired/`)

1. **Technical Debt Archaeology** - 70% overlap with Great Audit
2. **Knowledge Archaeology** - 60% overlap with Parallel Research + Session Summary
3. **Performance Cascade Analysis** - Low value (3/10), rare use case
4. **Semantic Harmonization** - Low value (3/10), naming-consultant suffices
5. **Dialectic Forge** - 85% overlap with Pair Consensus Dialectic (simpler, validated)
6. **Recursive Complexity Breakdown** - 70-90% overlap with task-decomposer (2025-12-28)

### Merge Candidates (in `.merge-candidates/`)

These flows can be integrated as variants of validated flows:

| Flow | Merge Into | As Variant |
