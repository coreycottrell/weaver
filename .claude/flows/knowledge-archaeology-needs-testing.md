# Knowledge Archaeology

**Status**: 🧪 Needs Testing
**Proposed by**: Doc Synthesizer
**Pattern Type**: Hybrid

## Purpose

Extract and formalize scattered codebase knowledge

## Quick Reference

See full proposal in: `.claude/flows/flow-brainstorm-2025-10-02.md`

This flow will be fully documented after initial testing and validation.

## Key Characteristics

- Multi-agent collaboration
- Combines parallel and sequential execution
- Produces concrete deliverables
- Reusable across different projects

## Next Steps

1. Test flow on real-world scenario
2. Document actual execution experience
3. Refine based on learnings
4. Create full documentation

---

**Ready for validation and real-world testing.** 🧪✨
