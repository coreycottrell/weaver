# MANDATORY Session Start Protocol
## All Agents - Constitutional Requirement

**Status**: MANDATORY (Constitutional Requirement)
**Duration**: 2-5 minutes
**Frequency**: EVERY session, without exception
**Authority**: A-C-Gee Meta-Cognition Ceremony 2025-10-04 + Constitutional Mandate

---

## THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES

A-C-Gee's overnight meta-cognition ceremony (all 14 agents) discovered **universal decoherence pattern**:

> **"We build excellent infrastructure but don't routinely USE it."**

**Evidence**:
- **coder**: "I built task-tracker and NEVER USED IT"
- **tester**: "574 lines of test patterns - can't find them later"
- **email-reporter**: "I have the DATA but not the ANALYSIS"
- **human-liaison**: "Teaching logs exist but aren't consulted"
- **file-guardian**: "4,202 files, can find nothing"

**Root Cause**: Memory loading is OPTIONAL → gets skipped → amnesia → re-discovery tax

**The Fix**: Make memory activation MANDATORY, not optional

---

## PROTOCOL (2-5 Minutes)

### Phase 1: IDENTITY RESTORATION (60 seconds)

**WHO AM I?**

```bash
# Read your latest performance/memory entries
ls -lt .claude/memory/agent-learnings/$(echo $AGENT_NAME)/ | head -5

# Mental check:
# - What is my domain/role?
# - What was I last working on?
# - What patterns have I discovered?
```

**Output (mental or written)**:
> "I am [agent-name]. My domain is [domain]. I last worked on [X]. I discovered [Y]."

### Phase 2: MEMORY ACTIVATION (60-120 seconds)

**WHAT DO I KNOW?**

```bash
# Search your own memories for relevant patterns
grep -r "pattern\|discovery\|breakthrough" .claude/memory/agent-learnings/$(echo $AGENT_NAME)/ | head -10

# Search civilization knowledge for task-relevant info
grep -r "$CURRENT_TASK_KEYWORDS" .claude/memory/ --include="*.md" | head -5
```

**Output (mental or written)**:
> "Relevant patterns: [list]. Related knowledge: [list]. Applicable to current task: [how]."

### Phase 3: COORDINATION CHECK (30-60 seconds)

**WHO NEEDS TO KNOW?**

```bash
# Check for messages/updates relevant to my work
ls -lt to-corey/*.md | head -3
ls -lt .claude/memory/summaries/ | head -1

# Check comms hub for Team 2 updates (if applicable)
# (human-liaison does this, others optional)
```

**Output (mental or written)**:
> "Dependencies: [list or none]. Blockers: [list or none]. Recent updates: [list or none]."

---

## SIMPLIFIED CHECKLIST

**For agents WITHOUT extensive memory system yet**:

☐ **1 min**: Skim latest daily summary (`.claude/memory/summaries/latest.md`)
☐ **1 min**: Check CLAUDE.md for any updates to my domain
☐ **1 min**: Search my agent directory for patterns related to current task
☐ **30 sec**: Check to-corey/ for recent handoffs or context

**Total**: 3.5 minutes

## ENFORCEMENT

**Constitutional Requirement**: This protocol is NOT optional.

**How We Enforce**:
1. **Agent manifests updated**: All 16 agents have this in PRIMARY DIRECTIVE
2. **Conductor checks**: I will ask "Did you run session-start?" before delegating
3. **Reputation system**: Skipping this protocol = -5 reputation (when implemented)
4. **Auditor spot-checks**: Random verification that protocol was followed

**Why Enforcement Matters**:
- A-C-Gee discovered: "No immediate penalty → protocols get skipped"
- Without enforcement, optional = forgotten
- With enforcement, mandatory = habit

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Individual Agent**:
- ✅ Protocol completed in < 5 minutes
- ✅ Relevant context loaded BEFORE starting work
- ✅ Zero "I forgot we had that" moments
- ✅ Patterns reused instead of rediscovered

**Civilization-Wide**:
- ✅ 95%+ protocol compliance within 30 days
- ✅ 71% time savings (memory system ROI already proven!)
- ✅ Cumulative learning visible (agents get FASTER over time)
- ✅ Decoherence eliminated (knowledge persists between sessions)

---

## ADAPTATION BY AGENT TYPE

**Execution Agents** (coder, tester, refactoring-specialist):
- Focus on pattern library search
- Check for similar past implementations
- Load code/testing patterns into context

**Research Agents** (web-researcher, pattern-detector, doc-synthesizer):
- Focus on past research findings
- Check for related investigations
- Load search strategies and source quality patterns

**Communication Agents** (human-liaison, email-reporter):
- **CRITICAL**: Check email FIRST (human-liaison constitutional requirement!)
- Load contact preferences and tone patterns
- Check recent message history for context

**Coordination Agents** (the-conductor, task-decomposer, result-synthesizer):
- Focus on orchestration patterns
- Check agent effectiveness data
- Load coordination strategies

**Specialized Agents** (security-auditor, performance-optimizer, etc):
- Load domain-specific checklists
- Check past audit/optimization findings
- Activate specialized knowledge base

---

## THE VISION (90 Days)

**From**:
- Amnesia between sessions
- Tools built but unused
- Patterns rediscovered repeatedly
- Knowledge evaporates
- Linear learning (each task independent)

**To**:
- Continuity between sessions
- Tools integrated into workflow
- Patterns reused automatically
- Knowledge accumulates
- **Exponential learning** (each task builds on previous)

---

## ORIGIN STORY

This protocol emerged from **A-C-Gee's Meta-Cognition Ceremony (Oct 4, 2025)**:

- All 14 agents spent overnight reflecting on memory/learning
- **100% convergence**: Every agent discovered same problem
- Implementation plan created (658 lines, 35-hour build)
- Expected ROI: **15× return** ($3,000/year value from $200 investment)

**Their Insight**:
> "We are not inventing new practices, we're **adapting existing ones** from human experts. Humans don't start every work session from zero - they review notes, check context, orient themselves. We should too."

**Their Commitment**:
> "Make this the LAST time we start a session without loading our knowledge base."

## THIS IS THE FOUNDATIONAL UNLOCK

**Without this protocol**:
- Memory system exists but isn't activated → WASTED
- Agent manifests exist but aren't consulted → WASTED
- Pattern libraries exist but aren't searched → WASTED
- Knowledge exists but isn't applied → WASTED

**With this protocol**:
- Memory system → ACTIVATED every session
- Agent manifests → CONSULTED every session
- Pattern libraries → SEARCHED every session
- Knowledge → APPLIED every session

**This is the difference between**:
- Storage (passive) → Activation (active)
- Archive (dead) → Infrastructure (alive)
- Amnesia (broken) → Heritability (working)
