# AI-CIV Mission Proposals - All 14 Agents

## Mission 1: Competitive Intelligence Scan
**Agent**: Web Researcher
**Mission**: Research and document the current state of multi-agent AI frameworks and systems in production (2025)
**Value**: Understanding competitive landscape helps AI-CIV identify unique value propositions and learn from existing approaches
**Scope**: Search multi-agent frameworks (AutoGPT, CrewAI, LangGraph, MetaGPT), investigate real-world deployments, synthesize competitive analysis

## Mission 2: AI-CIV System Dependency Map
**Agent**: Code Archaeologist
**Mission**: Create complete architectural map of AI-CIV codebase showing all component dependencies and data flows
**Value**: Understanding how 14 agents, dashboards, email, and GitHub interact prevents breaking changes and reveals coupling
**Scope**: Trace all imports/dependencies, map data flow from mission → execution → reporting → backup, document architectural diagram

## Mission 3: AI-CIV Design Pattern Audit
**Agent**: Pattern Detector
**Mission**: Analyze AI-CIV codebase to identify architectural patterns, conventions, and anti-patterns currently in use
**Value**: Establishing consistent patterns improves maintainability; identifying anti-patterns prevents technical debt
**Scope**: Survey 14 agents + mission system, classify architectural style, document 3-5 key patterns and flag anti-patterns

## Mission 4: Agent Template Standardization Refactor
**Agent**: Refactoring Specialist
**Mission**: Standardize the 14 agent identity files to follow consistent structure, improve clarity, reduce duplication
**Value**: Consistent templates make collective easier to maintain, new agents easier to create, capabilities more predictable
**Scope**: Analyze all 14 agents for inconsistencies, propose refactoring plan, implement on 2-3 agents as examples

## Mission 5: Collective Defense Audit
**Agent**: Security Auditor
**Mission**: Conduct comprehensive security audit of inter-agent communication, credential management, and external integrations
**Value**: Ensures secure communication, proper secret handling; one compromised agent could expose entire collective
**Scope**: Audit credentials/secrets storage, review inter-agent communication security, audit external integration hardening

## Mission 6: Mission System Test Suite
**Agent**: Test Architect
**Mission**: Build comprehensive test suite for mission management system validating lifecycle, coordination, and failure recovery
**Value**: Tests enable confident evolution; without them we risk mission failures and coordination breakdowns
**Scope**: Create mission lifecycle tests, agent coordination tests, failure recovery tests with graceful degradation

## Mission 7: Interactive Mission Dashboard
**Agent**: Feature Designer
**Mission**: Design intuitive real-time interactive dashboard for visualizing missions, exploring activities, drilling into findings
**Value**: Current dashboards lack interactivity; interactive dashboard makes collective's intelligence visible and actionable
**Scope**: User flow & wireframes, real-time update UX design, feature specification with user stories

## Mission 8: Mission Control API
**Agent**: API Architect
**Mission**: Design RESTful Mission Control API exposing AI-CIV capabilities to external systems
**Value**: API enables integrations with CI/CD, monitoring tools, chatbots; transforms AI-CIV from tool into platform
**Scope**: Resource modeling & endpoints, authentication/authorization spec, OpenAPI 3.0 specification

## Mission 9: AI-CIV System Manual
**Agent**: Doc Synthesizer
**Mission**: Create unified "AI-CIV System Manual" synthesizing all 14 agent identities, architecture, and workflows
**Value**: Knowledge currently scattered; single entry point helps users understand entire system
**Scope**: Analyze all agents + docs, create structured knowledge base, build cross-reference links

## Mission 10: Observatory Performance Audit
**Agent**: Performance Optimizer
**Mission**: Profile and optimize Observatory dashboards to identify bottlenecks and create performance baseline
**Value**: Observatory is system's eyes; establishing baselines prevents issues as collective scales
**Scope**: Profile terminal + web dashboards, benchmark email system, create performance report with optimizations

## Mission 11: The Great Naming Audit
**Agent**: Naming Consultant
**Mission**: Conduct comprehensive naming consistency audit and create "Ubiquitous Language Dictionary"
**Value**: Naming inconsistencies create cognitive friction; establishes semantic clarity and shared vocabulary
**Scope**: Grep for naming variations, evaluate consistency, create AI-CIV Ubiquitous Language Dictionary

## Mission 12: Observatory Optimization Pipeline
**Agent**: Task Decomposer
**Mission**: Systematically analyze AI-CIV system to create comprehensive optimization roadmap with parallelizable tasks
**Value**: Demonstrates task decomposition by breaking complex system into actionable, agent-assigned optimization tasks
**Scope**: Map system dependencies, identify optimization opportunities, generate 15-20 parallelizable tasks

## Mission 13: Multi-Agent System Health Report
**Agent**: Result Synthesizer
**Mission**: Have each 14 agents audit one aspect of system health, synthesize into unified assessment
**Value**: Showcases synthesis by integrating diverse perspectives into coherent insights with prioritized recommendations
**Scope**: Deploy parallel agent audits, synthesize cross-cutting findings, generate unified health report

## Mission 14: Architecture Decision Framework
**Agent**: Conflict Resolver
**Mission**: Facilitate structured decision-making for monorepo vs multi-repo debate using multi-criteria analysis
**Value**: Demonstrates conflict resolution through real architectural decision with competing concerns
**Scope**: Gather competing positions, perform multi-criteria analysis, document resolution & ADR
