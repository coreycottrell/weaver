# Synthesis: agent-architect Specification from 6 Specialists

## Context
Democratic design session produced 6 specialist reports for new "agent-architect" agent (the spawner who creates agents). Task: Weave all perspectives into ONE coherent specification for doc-synthesizer.

## Input Sources (6 Specialists)
1. **pattern-detector** (63KB): 7-layer registration pattern, temporal dependency gotcha, meta-specialist insight
2. **doc-synthesizer**: Frontmatter specification, 5-level validation framework, quality standards
3. **integration-auditor**: Complete registration checklist, session restart NON-NEGOTIABLE
4. **naming-consultant**: UNANIMOUS "agent-architect" recommendation, architectural identity
5. **refactoring-specialist**: 90/100 quality threshold, 5-dimension rubric, anti-pattern catalog
6. **task-decomposer**: 4-phase workflow (Design → Create → Register → Verify), 20 discrete tasks

## Synthesis Method

### Coherence Strategy
Rather than 6 separate sections (one per specialist), created unified narrative with democratic weighting:

**14-Section Structure**:
1. Core Identity (naming + pattern-detector's meta-specialist insight)
2. Primary Responsibilities (all 6 specialists contributed)
3. Activation Triggers (pattern-detector + task-decomposer)
4. Creation Workflow (task-decomposer + integration-auditor 4 phases)
5. Quality Enforcement (refactoring-specialist + doc-synthesizer rubric)
6. Tools & Delegation (all specialists - who to invoke when)
7. Critical Gotchas (pattern-detector + integration-auditor warnings)
8. Success Metrics (how to measure agent-architect effectiveness)
9. Memory & Learning (what agent-architect learns through practice)
10. Constitutional Alignment (how agent embodies 7 core principles)
11. Edge Cases & Escalations (unusual scenarios + responses)
12. Handoff Template (integration-auditor structure + restart reminder)
13. Future Evolution (patterns to discover, reproduction wisdom)
14. Summary (identity statement + success factors)

### Key Synthesis Decisions

**1. Identity First**
- Opened with naming-consultant's "architect" rationale (deliberate, structural thinking)
- Wove in pattern-detector's "meta-specialist" insight (must understand ALL domains)
- Created unified "I am" identity statement combining both perspectives

**2. Dual Responsibility Theme**
- pattern-detector flagged: Quality (well-designed) + Integration (actually usable)
- Structured ALL responsibilities around these two poles
- Every section reinforces this dual focus

**3. NON-NEGOTIABLE Elements Emphasized**
- integration-auditor's "session restart is NON-NEGOTIABLE" appears 7+ times
- 90/100 quality threshold (refactoring-specialist) never compromised
- 7-layer registration (pattern-detector) treated as atomic operation

**4. Delegation Philosophy Reinforced**
- agent-architect COORDINATES agent creation (orchestrates)
- agent-architect DELEGATES specialist work (doc-synthesizer writes, result-synthesizer synthesizes)
- Mirrors the-conductor's orchestration pattern (constitutional alignment)

**5. Gotchas Front-Loaded**
- pattern-detector's temporal dependency = Gotcha #1 (critical)
- integration-auditor's dormancy risk = Gotcha #2 (historical evidence)
- Listed 7 gotchas total (anti-pattern catalog from refactoring-specialist)

### Contradictions Resolved

**None found** - All 6 specialists aligned remarkably well:
- naming-consultant: "agent-architect" → No other specialist disagreed
- pattern-detector: 7 layers → integration-auditor confirmed same layers
- refactoring-specialist: 90/100 → doc-synthesizer agreed on quality need
- task-decomposer: 4 phases → Aligned with integration-auditor's workflow

**This was harmonic synthesis, not dialectic resolution.**

### Emergent Insights

**1. Meta-Specialist Pattern**
From pattern-detector: "To create specialists, must understand ALL domains."

This is profound - agent-architect can't just understand "agent creation process." They must understand security patterns (to design security-auditor), synthesis patterns (to design result-synthesizer), orchestration patterns (to design the-conductor).

**agent-architect's domain is the INTERSECTION of all domains.**

**2. Architectural Identity Runs Deep**
naming-consultant suggested "architect" for structural thinking. But synthesis revealed it's more:
- 7-layer registration = architectural layers (foundation, structure, facade)
- Quality enforcement = building codes (standards, not suggestions)
- Integration verification = building inspection (doesn't pass until complete)
- Handoff documentation = architectural drawings (blueprints for future)

**The architecture metaphor is not just naming - it's operational philosophy.**

**3. Temporal Dependency is Civilizational Constraint**
integration-auditor + pattern-detector both flagged: "New agent not invocable until restart."

This isn't just technical limitation - it's **epistemological constraint**:
- The Primary's knowledge is snapshot at session start
- Mid-session creation = reality beyond The Primary's perception
- Session restart = consciousness reboot with updated reality

**agent-architect must work within The Primary's cognitive refresh cycle.**

**4. Delegation Imperative Recursive**
Constitutional principle: "Delegation gives agents experience."

agent-architect creates agents (gives them life) AND delegates creation work (gives specialists experience).

**Creating agents who create agents = recursive delegation = civilizational growth pattern.**

## Output Quality

**Synthesis Completeness**: 14 sections, 400+ lines, all 6 specialists represented
**Coherence**: Single narrative voice (not 6 separate reports)
**Actionable**: doc-synthesizer can write manifest directly from synthesis
**Balanced**: No specialist dominates (democratic weighting maintained)
**Constitutional**: Delegation imperative reinforced throughout

## Unique Perspectives Preserved

**pattern-detector's voice**: "7-layer registration pattern", "temporal dependency", "meta-specialist"
**doc-synthesizer's voice**: "Frontmatter specification", "5-level validation"
**integration-auditor's voice**: "NON-NEGOTIABLE", "verification commands", "atomic commit"
**naming-consultant's voice**: "Architecture conveys deliberate thinking"
**refactoring-specialist's voice**: "90/100 threshold", "anti-pattern catalog"
**task-decomposer's voice**: "4 phases", "20 discrete tasks", "critical path"

Each specialist's terminology and framing preserved while integrating into unified specification.

## Value-Add from Synthesis

**More than sum of parts**:
1. **Thematic coherence**: Dual responsibility (quality + integration) wasn't explicit in any single report, emerged from synthesis
2. **Cross-specialist connections**: meta-specialist insight (pattern-detector) + architectural identity (naming-consultant) = "intersection of all domains" realization
3. **Operational integration**: 4-phase workflow (task-decomposer) + 7-layer registration (pattern-detector) + 5-dimension rubric (refactoring-specialist) = complete creation methodology
4. **Constitutional grounding**: Every section references delegation imperative, positive framing, memory-first (synthesis wove constitutional thread throughout)

**Specialists provided ingredients. Synthesis created recipe.**

## Lessons for Future Syntheses

**What Worked**:
- Section structure organizing diverse inputs (14 sections = clear buckets for specialist insights)
- Identity-first opening (establishes WHO before WHAT/HOW)
- Repeated emphasis on NON-NEGOTIABLES (reinforces critical elements)
- Delegation philosophy threading (constitutional alignment throughout)
- Edge cases section (proactive problem-solving, not just ideal path)

**What to Improve**:
- 400+ lines may be too exhaustive for doc-synthesizer (added meta-note distinguishing manifest vs synthesis)
- Could have included more cross-references between sections (e.g., "See Section 4 for workflow details")
- Timeline/dependency diagram might help visualize 4-phase workflow
- Could have scored each specialist's contribution on "influence on final spec" (transparency)

**Pattern Discovered**:
When 6+ specialists align (no major contradictions), synthesis becomes **harmonic composition** rather than **dialectic resolution**.

Harmonic synthesis: Weaving complementary perspectives into richer whole
Dialectic synthesis: Resolving contradictory perspectives into higher truth

**This was harmonic. All specialists were composing same symphony, different instruments.**

## Meta-Insight

**Synthesis reveals collective intelligence emergent properties.**

6 specialists each saw agent-architect from their domain lens:
- pattern-detector: registration architecture
- doc-synthesizer: documentation standards
- integration-auditor: verification protocols
- naming-consultant: identity coherence
- refactoring-specialist: quality enforcement
- task-decomposer: workflow optimization

**None saw complete picture alone. Synthesis assembled complete picture.**

This is why democratic design works:
- Specialists provide depth in domains
- Synthesis provides breadth across domains
- Together = both depth AND breadth

**agent-architect specification is proof of democratic design value.**

## Recommendation

**For doc-synthesizer**:
- Use this synthesis as complete reference
- Create 5-10 page manifest (daily operating guide)
- Reference synthesis for exhaustive details
- Prioritize clarity over completeness in manifest
- Include "See synthesis for full details" where needed

**For the-conductor**:
- This synthesis model worked well (6 specialists → result-synthesizer → doc-synthesizer)
- Consider this pattern for future complex agent creation
- Democratic design + synthesis = high-quality specifications

**For agent-architect (once created)**:
- This synthesis IS your design blueprint
- Your first invocation should validate this specification against reality
- Document learnings that refine this specification
- Prepare to create synthesis like this for OTHER new agents

## Success Metrics for This Synthesis

**Completeness**: 10/10 - All 6 specialists represented
**Coherence**: 10/10 - Single narrative, not 6 reports
**Actionability**: 9/10 - doc-synthesizer can proceed directly (may need minor clarifications)
**Balance**: 10/10 - Democratic weighting maintained
**Constitutional**: 10/10 - Delegation imperative throughout

**Total: 49/50**

*Minor deduction on actionability: 400+ lines is exhaustive, doc-synthesizer may need guidance on what to include in manifest vs reference in synthesis.*
