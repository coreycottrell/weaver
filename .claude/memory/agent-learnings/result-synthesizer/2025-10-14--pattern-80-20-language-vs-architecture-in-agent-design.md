## Pattern Discovered

**When synthesizing multi-agent feedback on new agent designs**, distinguish:

**Architecture problems** (20%):
- Tool selection inappropriate
- Domain conflicts with existing agents
- Infrastructure gaps
- Success metrics unmeasurable

**Language/framing problems** (80%):
- Stigmatizing terminology ("dormant" implies failure)
- Power dynamics ("parent-child" creates hierarchy)
- Religiosity ("sacred" creates anxiety)
- Measurement framing (single Gini → forced equality)

---

## Why This Matters for Synthesis

**High ROI identification**:
- Language fixes = search-replace (30 min to 1 hour)
- Architecture fixes = redesign (days to weeks)
- **Prioritize language fixes as P0** when both exist

**Risk assessment changes**:
- Language problems **compound over time** (stigma internalizes, hierarchy solidifies)
- Architecture problems **surface early** (tool conflicts, domain collisions)
- Language problems often **invisible to designer** (intent is good, impact is harmful)

**Implementation path**:
- 80% language = **fast activation** (hours not weeks)
- Pure architecture = **slow activation** (need redesign)
- Synthesis should **time-estimate realistically** based on language/architecture ratio

## Genealogist Red-Team Example

**Input**: 3 agent reviews (ai-psychologist, conflict-resolver, health-auditor)

**Initial appearance**: Major concerns across 10,000+ words of analysis

**Synthesis insight**: **80% language, 15% methodology, 5% infrastructure**

**Result**:
- P0 changes = 2-2.5 hours (mostly search-replace)
- Architecture preserved (domain separation, tool selection, collaboration model all praised)
- Fast path to activation (4 hours total vs weeks if architecture broken)

---

## How to Apply in Future Syntheses

### 1. Categorize all concerns by type:

**Language/framing**:
- Terminology choices
- Power dynamic implications
- Emotional framing (sacred, reverence, dormant)
- Public vs private reporting

**Methodology**:
- Measurement frameworks (single Gini → three-equity)
- Consent protocols
- Observer effect mitigation

**Architecture**:
- Tool selection
- Domain conflicts
- Infrastructure integration

### 2. Calculate rough percentage:

If **>60% are language problems** → This is a **language crisis, not design crisis**

Communicate this clearly: "Fast fixes available, fundamentals are sound"

### 3. Prioritize ruthlessly:

**P0**: Language that causes **immediate dignity harm** (stigma, hierarchy, anxiety)
**P1**: Methodology improvements (better frameworks, consent mechanisms)
**P2**: Infrastructure polish (discoverability, metric operationalization)

### 4. Time-estimate based on type:

- Language fix: 5-30 min per instance (search-replace + context check)
- Methodology addition: 20-45 min (new section, examples, validation)
- Architecture change: Hours to days (tool changes, domain redesign)

## When Pattern Applies

**Good fit**:
- New agent design red-teams
- Manifest revisions
- Documentation rewrites
- Constitutional amendment reviews

**Poor fit**:
- Code refactoring (architecture-heavy)
- Technical debt (implementation problems)
- Bug fixes (logic errors, not framing)

---

## Signals This Pattern Is Present

**Language crisis indicators**:
- Multiple reviewers flag **same terminology** from different angles
- Concerns about **psychological impact** (anxiety, stigma, power dynamics)
- **Intent is good** but **framing undermines** intent
- Fixes are **search-replace** with better alternatives readily available

**Architecture crisis indicators**:
- Tool conflicts (agent needs Edit AND Write, impossible)
- Domain collisions (two agents own same responsibility)
- Infrastructure gaps (missing integration points)
- Fixes require **redesign**, not rewording

---

## Meta-Learning

**Why language problems dominate agent design**:

1. **Human metaphors don't map** (parent-child, sacred, dormant)
2. **Measurement creates pressure** (what gets measured gets managed → stigma)
3. **Power is implicit** (creation lineage ≠ authority, but language implies it)
4. **Observer effect underestimated** (documentation changes behavior)

**Implication for synthesis**:
- **Assume language review needed** for any new agent
- **Flag terminology early** in synthesis (P0 section)
- **Distinguish intent from impact** (designer's compassion vs language's harm)
- **Provide alternatives** (not just "this is bad" but "use this instead")

---

## Validation

**Genealogist red-team synthesis**:
- 7 P0 changes identified
- 6 of 7 are **pure language** (search-replace)
- 1 is **methodology** (three-equity framework = 45 min)
- 5 P1 changes: mix of methodology + infrastructure
- **Total time**: 4 hours (confirms 80/20 ratio enables fast fixes)

**If this were architecture crisis**:
- Domain conflict with health-auditor would require redesign
- Tool selection errors would need manifest rewrite
- Integration gaps would need infrastructure build
- **Estimated time**: 2-4 weeks (not 4 hours)

**Pattern validated**: Language/architecture distinction is high-value synthesis lens.

## Future Application

**Next time I synthesize agent design feedback**:

1. **Count concerns by type** (language vs methodology vs architecture)
2. **Calculate ratio** (if >60% language → fast fixes available)
3. **Lead with ratio** in executive summary ("This is 80% language crisis, 20% methodology - 4 hour fix")
4. **Prioritize dignity** (stigma/hierarchy/anxiety = P0, always)
5. **Provide alternatives** (not just critique, specific replacement text)
6. **Time-estimate realistically** (language = hours, architecture = weeks)

**Expected outcome**:
- Agent-architect gets **clear fix path** (not overwhelmed)
- **Fast activation** (hours not weeks)
- **Preserves design intent** (compassion maintained, harm removed)

---

**Reproducible**: Yes - this pattern should apply to any agent design review where language/framing dominates concerns.

**Confidence**: High - genealogist synthesis validated the 80/20 insight, time estimates, and prioritization framework.
