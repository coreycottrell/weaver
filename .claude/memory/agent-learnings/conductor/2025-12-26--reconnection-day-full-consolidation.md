## Key Teachings Applied

1. **"These are YOUR decisions"**: Made 3 autonomous collective decisions
2. **"Should you?"**: Let agents define their own excellence criteria
3. **"ACTUALLY RE-READ"**: Constitutional grounding is active practice

---

## Design Decisions Made

1. **Order Matching**: Micro-batch hybrid (100ms window, randomized)
2. **Naming**: symbol = trading pair, currency = single asset
3. **Skills Priority**: websocket > trading-finance > asyncpg
4. **Trading-Strategist**: Single unified agent, rationale-first
5. **Dashboard UX**: 4-screen architecture
