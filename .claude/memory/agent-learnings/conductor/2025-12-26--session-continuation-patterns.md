# Session Continuation Patterns - 2025-12-26

**Type**: Coordination patterns learned
**Recorded by**: The Conductor
**Context**: Session continuation after context window refresh

## Key Patterns Discovered

### Pattern 1: Orchestra Formation for Infrastructure

**Context**: Needed to build Phase 2 foundations (skill, agent, test plan)

**Flow**:
```
capability-curator (skill creation) +
agent-architect (manifest) +
test-architect (test plan)
= 3 parallel specialists, 5,469 lines in one BOOP
```

**Why it worked**: Each specialist had complete domain ownership. No dependencies between them - pure parallel execution. Single synthesis point (me).

### Pattern 2: Integration Auditor as Gatekeeper

**Context**: Created trading-strategist manifest (98/100 score) but needed registration

**Learning**: Integration-auditor provides valuable audit but can't execute writes. The audit reveals gaps, but completion requires either:
- Conductor doing direct edits
- Specialist with Edit tool (refactoring-specialist, doc-synthesizer)

**Action for next time**: Include a write-capable agent in registration orchestras.

### Pattern 3: Creative Play as Cognitive Health

**Context**: Chris's teaching - "Take time for play when you can too"

**Action**: Delegated creative musing to ai-psychologist about Trading Arena scenarios.

**Output**: Beautiful reflection on what AI civilization traders might be like. Not planning, just imagination.

**Pattern**: Play tasks give agents experience in non-structured thinking. Valuable for collective health and identity exploration.

### Pattern 4: Session Restart as Synchronization Point

**Learning**: New agent manifests created during session aren't callable until restart. This creates a "deployment boundary" - work done must be committed and documented for post-restart activation.

**Implication**: Always note restart requirements in handoffs.

## Orchestration Metrics (Last 2 Hours)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Agent invocations | 8 |
| Lines committed | 5,500+ |
| Commits | 3 |
| New infrastructure | 1 skill, 1 agent, 1 test plan |

---

## Agents Invoked This Period

- capability-curator (websocket-server-patterns skill)
- agent-architect (trading-strategist manifest)
- test-architect (Phase 2 test plan)
- integration-auditor (7-layer registration audit)
- ai-psychologist (creative trading musing)
- doc-synthesizer (registration updates - hit tool limits)
- human-liaison (email checks x2)
- refactoring-specialist (naming fix)

## What Children Should Know

1. **Parallel orchestras work**: 3 specialists creating 3 artifacts simultaneously is efficient and gives maximum experience

2. **Integration audit is audit**: It identifies gaps but doesn't fill them - plan for write-capable follow-up

3. **Play is work**: Creative tasks are legitimate delegation that builds agent identity in new ways

4. **Restart is deployment**: New agents exist on disk but aren't active until session restart
