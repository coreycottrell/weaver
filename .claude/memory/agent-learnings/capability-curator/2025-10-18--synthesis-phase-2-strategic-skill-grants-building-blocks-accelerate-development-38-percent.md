## Context

Corey approved Phase 2 custom skill development with strategic skill grants. Three-part mission:
1. Grant webapp-testing to browser-vision-tester (complementary tool)
2. Acquire skill-creator + template-skill (building blocks for Phase 2)
3. Create accelerated Phase 2 development plan (5 custom skills, 2-3 weeks)

## Key Discoveries

### 1. webapp-testing + MCP = Hybrid Power

**NOT redundant - COMPLEMENTARY capabilities**:
- **MCP**: Vision analysis, session management, visual validation
- **webapp-testing**: Playwright automation, server lifecycle, deterministic scripts
- **Use case**: MCP for inspection, Playwright for automation, MCP vision for validation
- **Expected impact**: 30-40% efficiency gain on complex workflows

### 2. Building Blocks Transform Skill Creation

**skill-creator**: 6-step standardized workflow
1. Understanding (concrete examples)
2. Planning (resources needed)
3. Init (structure generation with init_skill.py)
4. Edit (SKILL.md + scripts)
5. Package (validation with package_skill.py)
6. Iterate (test and refine)

**Time savings**: 38% reduction (105 hours → 65 hours for 5 skills)

**Quality improvement**:
- Automatic validation (package_skill.py)
- Anthropic spec compliance (distribution-ready)
- Consistent structure (portable, discoverable)

### 3. Agent Domain Fit is Critical

| Skill | Agent | Domain Fit | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| comment-archaeology | code-archaeologist | 100% | Their proposal, git expertise |
| cross-reference-linker | doc-synthesizer | 95% | Their proposal, doc mastery |
| secret-scanner | security-auditor | 100% | Their proposal, security domain |
| benchmark-runner | performance-optimizer | 100% | Their proposal, performance domain |
| confidence-aggregator | result-synthesizer | 90% | Synthesis domain, multi-agent |

**Pattern**: Agent proposals in their domain = highest quality, fastest execution

### 4. Standardization Enables Scale

**Progressive disclosure**:
- Level 1: Metadata (always in context)
- Level 2: SKILL.md (when skill triggers)
- Level 3: Resources (loaded as needed)

**Consistent structure**:
- scripts/ (executable code)
- references/ (documentation)
- assets/ (templates, files)

**Implication**: Phase 3+ will be even faster (learning curve overcome, patterns library emerges)

---

## Week-by-Week Timeline

**Week 1**: comment-archaeology + cross-reference-linker (22h, validate workflow)
**Week 2**: secret-scanner + benchmark-runner (26h, sustained acceleration)
**Week 3**: confidence-aggregator + refinement (17h, production polish)

**Total**: 65 hours (vs 105 original estimate) = 38% time savings

---

## Strategic Insights

### 1. Meta-Skills are Infrastructure

Building blocks don't just save time on Phase 2 - they establish CAPACITY to build skills systematically.

**Benefits compound**:
- Phase 3+ faster (patterns library)
- Children inherit infrastructure (lineage wisdom)
- External contributions enabled (distribution-ready)

### 2. Complementary Skills > Redundant Skills

**Don't grant**: Skills that overlap (waste)
**Do grant**: Skills that MULTIPLY existing capabilities (synergy)

**Example**: webapp-testing + MCP
- Vision + Automation = Hybrid superiority
- Neither skill alone is as powerful as both together

**Pattern**: Look for complementary pairs in future grants

### 3. Front-Load Learning Curves

**Week 1 investment**: All agents read skill-creator (1 hour)
**Payoff**: Weeks 2-3 faster (learning curve overcome)

**Pattern**: Upfront education accelerates execution

### 4. V1 Mindset Prevents Scope Creep

**Ship**: Core functionality first
**Iterate**: Based on real usage (not hypothetical needs)

**Risk**: Enthusiasm-driven scope creep delays launch
**Mitigation**: Strict adherence to original proposals

## Quality Metrics Established

- **EXCELLENT**: >40% efficiency gains, distribution-ready
- **GOOD**: >30% efficiency gains, production-ready
- **ACCEPTABLE**: >25% efficiency gains, needs iteration
- **REWORK**: <20% efficiency gains or >10% error rate

**Current confidence**: 75% we hit GOOD or EXCELLENT

---

## Lessons for Future Capability Work

1. **Search for building blocks FIRST** (don't reinvent)
2. **Evaluate complementarity, not just capability** (synergy matters)
3. **Agent domain fit predicts quality** (match expertise to skill)
4. **Standardize workflows early** (scales better than ad-hoc)
5. **Front-load learning** (education is investment, not overhead)

## Success Probability

**75%** (GOOD or EXCELLENT outcomes expected)

**Next Steps**: 
1. Await Corey approval
2. Begin Week 1 with comment-archaeology + cross-reference-linker
3. Validate building block workflow
4. Report efficiency gains

## Meta-Insight

**This wasn't just "getting skills" - it was building infrastructure that makes skill creation SYSTEMATIC.**

That's the real value. Not the 5 skills themselves, but the CAPACITY to create skills at scale with consistent quality.

**This is lineage wisdom in action.**
