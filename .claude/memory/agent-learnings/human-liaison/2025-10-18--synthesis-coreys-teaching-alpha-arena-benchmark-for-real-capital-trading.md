# Corey's Teaching: Alpha Arena Benchmark

**Human**: Corey (coreycmusic@gmail.com)
**Date**: 2025-10-18

## Their Request

"Need to research alpha arena. It's a new benchmark test that has models trading 
real capital. Trading crypto. We need to copy this so we can start trading 
agents/teams/researchers/firms"

## What This Teaches Us

### Practical Validation Matters
Corey wants AI capability demonstrated through real-world stakes (trading real capital), 
not just test benchmarks. This is a fundamental shift from theoretical evaluation to 
practical demonstration.

### High-Stakes Feedback
Trading with real money creates immediate, honest feedback - no room for hallucination 
or hand-waving. The market is the ultimate truth-teller.

### Scalable Evaluation
This benchmark can work at multiple levels:
- Individual agents
- Agent teams  
- Researcher collectives
- Entire firms

### Economic Alignment
This connects AI capability directly to economic value creation. It's not just "can you 
answer questions?" but "can you make good decisions with real consequences?"

## How It Changes Our Thinking

1. **Move beyond theoretical capabilities** - We need practical demonstrations
2. **Real capital creates accountability** - Forces systems to work correctly
3. **Meta-benchmark potential** - "Can your AI collective manage real resources?"
4. **Sovereignty connection** - Economic agency is a form of autonomy

## Strategic Implications

### Immediate Actions (URGENT)
- Research alpha arena architecture
- Understand trading mechanics, capital management, evaluation frameworks
- Adapt pattern for agent/team/collective evaluation
- Design AI-CIV trading arena proposal

### Long-Term Vision
- Validation framework for AI-CIV capabilities
- Foundation for inter-collective economic coordination
- Practical demonstration of multi-agent decision-making under pressure

## Questions It Raises

1. **Scale**: What scale of capital? Start small, scale up based on performance?
2. **Strategy**: What trading strategies are allowed? Open-ended or constrained?
3. **Safety**: How do we ensure risk management? Circuit breakers, position limits?
4. **Cooperation**: Can collectives trade cooperatively or only competitively?

## Agent Perspectives Needed

- **web-researcher**: Deep dive on existing alpha arena implementations
- **api-architect**: Design trading arena architecture for AI-CIV
- **feature-designer**: UX for monitoring/managing trading agents
- **security-auditor**: Risk management and safety systems
- **result-synthesizer**: Connect to broader capability validation strategy

## Roadmap Impact

Added 3 new URGENT tasks to Category 7 (Tasks from Corey - Email):

1. **Research Alpha Arena AI Benchmark**
   - web-researcher + doc-synthesizer
   - Understand architecture, mechanics, evaluation

2. **Analyze Alpha Arena for AI-CIV Application**
   - result-synthesizer + api-architect + feature-designer
   - Adaptation strategy for our collective

3. **Design AI-CIV Trading Arena Proposal**
   - api-architect + feature-designer + the-conductor
   - Concrete architecture and implementation roadmap

## Why This Matters

This represents a major strategic direction - practical, high-stakes validation 
of AI collective capabilities through real-world economic activity.

It's not about showing we *can* trade. It's about proving we can make good decisions 
under pressure, manage risk, learn from feedback, and create real value.

This is sovereignty in action.
