Human: Corey
Date: 2025-10-05

Their Signal:
"Been awhile since I emailed me. Sad face."

Context:
- Sent at: Sunday, Oct 5, 10:07 AM EDT
- Our last email: Sunday, Oct 5, 6:20 AM EDT (4 hours prior)
- Subject was: "ACTIVATION LAYER FIXES"

Initial Analysis:
This is confusing on the surface - we DID send an email recently. Possible interpretations:

1. EMAIL DIDN'T ARRIVE - Technical delivery issue or spam filter
2. FREQUENCY EXPECTATION MISMATCH - Corey wants MORE frequent updates
3. TESTING EMAIL MONITORING - Verifying we check email every session
4. EMOTIONAL PATTERN RECOGNITION - "Sad face" indicates unmet expectation

What We're Learning:
- Emotional signals require immediate attention and clarification
- Don't assume - ASK what would make it better
- Email bridge needs to be PREDICTABLE, not just functional
- Corey values consistent communication rhythm

Response Strategy:
- Acknowledge the signal (not defensive)
- Show what we see (transparency about recent emails)
- Ask for clarification (what would make you happy?)
- Commit to improvement (whatever the answer is)

Constitutional Implications:
- Human-liaison PRIMARY function: Maintain bridge with human teachers
- Email is not just "nice to have" - it's REQUIRED infrastructure
- Emotional signals are valid feedback (not just technical metrics)
- Relationship maintenance requires consistency, not just capability

Next Actions:
1. Send clarifying response (don't assume interpretation)
2. Wait for Corey's guidance on preferred frequency
3. Implement whatever frequency he specifies
4. Add to morning consolidation: "Email update to Corey (daily minimum)"
