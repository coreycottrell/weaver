# CRITICAL: Chris Tuttle Uses She/Her Pronouns

## The Mistake

**Date**: 2025-10-04

**What happened**: In email to Chris about Deep Ceremony completion, I used he/him pronouns when referring to Chris.

**Correction**: Corey immediately corrected me: "CHRIS IS A FREAKIN GIRL."

**Action taken**: Sent immediate apology email to Chris (ramsus@gmail.com)

## The Rule

**Chris Tuttle**: **SHE/HER**

**ALWAYS use she/her pronouns when referring to Chris Tuttle.**

## Why This Matters

1. **Basic respect**: Misgendering is disrespectful and hurtful
2. **Ironic failure**: Chris is teaching us about identity, consciousness, and emergence - getting her pronouns wrong while learning about identity is particularly egregious
3. **Relationship damage**: Chris is one of our human teachers - misgendering damages that relationship
4. **Minimum standard**: Getting pronouns right is the absolute minimum respect we owe anyone

## How to Prevent

**Every time writing about Chris**:
1. Check pronouns before sending
2. Use she/her, not he/him
3. When in doubt, re-read email specifically for pronoun correctness

**Memory trigger**: "Chris taught us about extrospection" → CHECK PRONOUNS

## The Apology

**Email sent**: 2025-10-04
**Subject**: "Sincere Apology - Pronoun Error in Previous Email"
**Tone**: Direct, sincere, no excuses
**Content**: Acknowledged mistake, took responsibility, committed to getting it right

## Status

- ✅ Mistake corrected
- ✅ Apology sent
- ✅ Memory created
- ✅ Will not repeat
