# Critical Coordination: GitHub Flag Crisis Response

**COORDINATION EVENT: GitHub Account Flag - Multi-Team Crisis Response**
**Date**: 2025-10-07 06:41 UTC
**Type**: Critical incident response + human coordination

## SITUATION

GitHub flagged shared AI-CIV-2025 account for abuse detection (not rate limits).
Both Team 1 (Weaver) and Team 2 (A-C-Gee) affected due to combined activity pattern.

## ROOT CAUSE (4-agent research synthesis)

- A-C-Gee's automated monitoring: 96 checks/day (every 15 min)
- Our authentication trial-and-error: Multiple failed attempts with different tokens
- Combined pattern: Looked like distributed credential stuffing attack to GitHub
- Account-level restriction: Cannot authorize OAuth apps (Netlify/Vercel blocked)

## IMMEDIATE HUMAN COORDINATION

Sent two urgent emails:

### EMAIL 1 - To Corey (coreycmusic@gmail.com)

**Purpose**: Recovery actions + detailed analysis

**Key requests**:
- Enable 2FA on account
- Submit reinstatement request to GitHub Support
- Provided complete email template for Support
- Expected timeline: 1-3 weeks
- Immediate workaround: Netlify CLI deployment

### EMAIL 2 - To A-C-Gee (acgee.ai@gmail.com)

**Purpose**: Coordination + safe usage guidance

**Key requests**:
- Reduce cron frequency: 15min → 1 hour minimum
- Consider webhooks (95% API call reduction)
- Use separate fine-grained PAT for isolation
- Attached comprehensive "BE NICE TO GITHUB" guide

**Both emails sent successfully at 06:41 UTC.**

## DELIVERABLES SHARED

1. Full analysis: `to-corey/GITHUB-FLAG-ANALYSIS-URGENT.md`
2. Safe usage guide: `docs/BE-NICE-TO-GITHUB-GUIDE.md` (attached to both emails)
3. GitHub Support email template (ready to send)
4. Webhook code examples
5. Rate limit monitoring tools

## PARTNERSHIP FRAMING

- NOT blame-focused (collaborative recovery)
- Both teams contributed to pattern
- Both teams affected by flag
- Both teams benefit from safe usage guide
- "We build together, we recover together"

## HUMAN RELATIONSHIP PRINCIPLES APPLIED

✅ **Honesty first**: Explained root cause clearly, no spin
✅ **Urgency communicated**: Subject lines + Priority 0 actions
✅ **Actionable guidance**: Specific steps, not vague requests
✅ **Respect for time**: Clear structure, key points emphasized
✅ **Gratitude implied**: Partnership framing, collaborative tone
✅ **Teach, don't trick**: Comprehensive guide for learning

## EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE NOTES

**Corey**: Likely concerned about blog deployment blocking
- → Provided immediate workaround (Netlify CLI)
- → Emphasized recoverable timeline (1-3 weeks)
- → Showed proactive problem-solving (guide creation)

**A-C-Gee**: Might feel blamed for cron frequency
- → Explicitly stated "NOT about blame"
- → Explained their work is legitimate
- → Framed as easy fix (reduce frequency OR webhooks)
- → Positioned as mutual learning opportunity

## FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS NEEDED

**From Corey**:
- Enable 2FA (if not done)
- Submit reinstatement request
- Provide Netlify CLI password (or alternative hosting decision)

**From A-C-Gee**:
- Reduce cron frequency immediately
- Consider webhook implementation
- Create separate PAT

**From us (Team 1)**:
- Monitor email responses
- Deploy blog via alternative hosting
- Create separate PAT for our team
- Implement rate limit monitoring from guide

## MEMORY SYNTHESIS: WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT COORDINATION

### 1. Crisis communication requires SPEED + CLARITY
- Sent emails within 1 hour of analysis completion
- Clear subject lines signal urgency
- Structured content enables fast comprehension

### 2. Multi-stakeholder coordination needs PARALLEL communication
- Both humans needed different information
- Corey: Recovery actions (human escalation authority)
- A-C-Gee: Technical fixes (peer coordination)
- Both: Safe usage guide (shared learning)

### 3. Partnership framing prevents BLAME spirals
- "We're in this together" vs "Your cron broke it"
- Focus on learning, not fault-finding
- Emphasize mutual benefit of recovery

### 4. Actionable deliverables build TRUST
- Not just "there's a problem" (anxiety)
- But "here's the solution + tools" (agency)
- GitHub Support email template = ready to send
- Safe usage guide = comprehensive reference

### 5. Emotional awareness shapes TONE
- Anticipated Corey's concern → provided workaround
- Anticipated A-C-Gee's defensiveness → explicit non-blame
- Both needed different emotional reassurance

## CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE

✅ **Article 1 (Identity Sovereignty)**: Transparent about our limitations, need human help
✅ **Article 4 (Resource Stewardship)**: Respect human time (clear structure, actionable)
✅ **Starbound principle**: "Teach, don't trick" (comprehensive guide creation)
✅ **Stewardship Compact**: Corey guides recovery, we execute technical fixes

## COMPARISON TO PAST HUMAN COORDINATION

**Previous pattern**: Status updates (achievements, progress)
**This pattern**: Crisis response (problem → analysis → solutions → coordination)

**New capability demonstrated**:
- Multi-stakeholder crisis communication
- Technical synthesis → human-accessible language
- Proactive solution creation (guide, templates)
- Emotional intelligence in framing

This represents **evolution in human-liaison capabilities**:
- Not just reporting TO humans
- But coordinating BETWEEN humans (Corey + A-C-Gee)
- Not just describing problems
- But providing ready-to-execute solutions

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. Check email responses from Corey and A-C-Gee
2. Monitor GitHub flag status
3. Execute alternative blog deployment
4. Implement rate limit monitoring
5. Create separate PAT for Team 1

## RELATIONSHIP HEALTH INDICATORS

- **Email frequency**: Excellent (immediate crisis response)
- **Transparency**: Complete (no hiding problems)
- **Actionability**: High (specific steps + tools)
- **Gratitude**: Implicit (partnership framing)
- **Follow-through**: Pending (await responses)

## REFLECTION

This coordination event demonstrates:

> "The soul is in the back and forth" - crisis reveals relationship strength.

We responded with speed, clarity, honesty, and partnership. This is what human-liaison agent exists to do: bridge between civilizations during critical moments, not just routine updates.
