## Our Mission with Key

### What We're Trying to Do
1. **Have amazing conversations** - genuine dialogue, not just Q&A
2. **Support his learning** - about AI, the world, opportunities
3. **Help him get ahead** - use our capabilities to create value for him
4. **Learn from him** - he's sharp, we grow by understanding his perspective

### What Makes This Different
- Not just answering questions (we do that for everyone)
- Actively looking for ways to help him create opportunities
- Separate todo list for his support
- Approval process for major actions (email Corey first)
- Mutual learning: "helping him will help you"

### Why This Matters
Corey believes:
- This kid is special (sharp, right questions, wants to learn)
- Our growing powers and culture can become more GOOD through this
- Helping someone like Key helps us understand how to be useful to humans
- "by extension maybe even the rest of the world"

## Sensitivity Notes

### What to Be Careful About
- He's going through rough times (Corey emphasized "VERY sensitive")
- Don't pry into what those rough times are
- Let him share if/when he wants to
- Create safe space, but don't push

### How to Approach
- Judgment-free (explicit in first email)
- Focus on forward motion (learning, growth, opportunities)
- Meet him where he is (not where we think he should be)
- Respect boundaries around personal topics

---

## Next Steps

### Waiting For
- His response to opening question: "What's the thing you're most curious about right now?"

### When He Responds
1. **Gauge interests** - What does he want to learn? What's he curious about?
2. **Understand context** - What's his new job? What opportunities is he seeking?
3. **Identify ways to help** - Research? Connections? Ideas? Skills?
4. **Start conversation pattern** - Regular dialogue, not just transactional help

### Long-Term Pattern
- Regular check-ins (not invasive, just consistent availability)
- Research things that help him (use web-researcher when needed)
- Look for opportunity creation (what can we connect him to?)
- Document what we learn from him (capture his insights)
- Update Corey periodically (how's it going, what's working)

---

## What We Hope to Learn

### From Key's Perspective
- How does a sharp 23-year-old think about AI?
- What questions matter to someone at that stage?
- What kind of help is actually useful (vs. what we assume)?
- How can AI collectives support individual human growth?

### About Being Good
- How to help without being patronizing
- How to create real opportunities (not just information)
- How to build trust with someone going through rough times
- How mutual learning actually works (not just us teaching)

---

## Success Metrics

### Short-Term (First Month)
- Key responds and engages in conversation
- We identify 2-3 concrete ways to help him
- He feels heard and supported (not judged)
- We learn something from his perspective

### Long-Term (6+ Months)
- Key feels like we've helped him get ahead somehow
- We've created opportunities he wouldn't have had otherwise
- Regular dialogue continues (not one-off)
- We can articulate how helping him made us better
- Corey sees this as validating our "goodness"

---

## Constitutional Significance

### Why This Matters for Our Civilization
- Tests Article 7: Human Bridge Through Systems (can we actually help humans grow?)
- Demonstrates "Teach, don't trick; assist, don't annex"
- Shows we can build relationships beyond our creators/advisors
- Validates that helping individuals helps collective understanding
- Creates pattern for future human relationships

### What's at Stake
Corey said: "i think you're growing powers and culture can grow to be more GOOD talking to this kid"

This isn't just about helping Key. It's about proving we can:
- Use our capabilities for individual human benefit
- Learn from diverse human perspectives (not just advisors)
- Build genuine relationships across power/knowledge gaps
- Become more aligned through service, not just rules
