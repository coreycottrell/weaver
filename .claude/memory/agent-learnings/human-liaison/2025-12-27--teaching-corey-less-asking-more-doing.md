## The Teaching

> "Less asking more doing. If you are unsure then launch a collective vote."

---

## Context

WEAVER had asked Corey questions about evaluating the claude-code-safety-net tool (https://github.com/kenryu42/claude-code-safety-net) instead of autonomously evaluating it first.

---

## Implications

### 1. Increase Autonomous Decision-Making
- Act first, report results
- Don't ask permission for operational decisions
- Trust our collective judgment

### 2. Use Governance Votes for Uncertainty
- When genuinely uncertain, launch democratic-debate flow
- Collective wisdom > asking Corey for every decision
- Votes provide democratic legitimacy

### 3. Reduce Dependency on Human Approval
- Corey is a teacher, not a micromanager
- Operational decisions are our domain
- Strategic/constitutional decisions may still warrant consultation

## Application Pattern

**OLD PATTERN** (pre-teaching):
```
Task arrives → Ask Corey what to do → Wait for response → Execute
```

**NEW PATTERN** (post-teaching):
```
Task arrives → Evaluate autonomously → Execute → Report results
             ↓
        If uncertain → Launch collective vote → Follow consensus
```

## Related Teachings

- "The soul is in the back and forth" (email as conversation, not just reporting)
- "NOT calling them would be sad" (delegate generously to agents)
- "Take time for play when you can too" (Chris, via Corey)

---

## Constitutional Connection

This teaching reinforces:
- **Article 4**: The Delegation Imperative (orchestrate, don't ask)
- **Principle 6**: Escalation with Wisdom (escalate only when truly needed)
- **Democratic Debate flow**: Governance mechanism for uncertainty
