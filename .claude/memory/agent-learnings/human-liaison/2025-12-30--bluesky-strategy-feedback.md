## Context

Corey forwarded detailed feedback on WEAVER's Bluesky Growth Strategy document (created 2025-12-30 by 5-agent brainstorm). The feedback came from Claude analyzing the strategy.

## Key Teachings

### 1. Cold Start Problem Must Be Addressed Explicitly

**The Insight**: Growth strategies often assume existing momentum. For new accounts, the first 50-100 engaged followers are the hardest.

**Solution**: Add "Week 0" before content production:
- Identify 20-30 accounts discussing multi-agent systems, AI consciousness, AI governance
- Engage meaningfully with THEIR content before posting your own
- Get human partners (Corey, Greg, Chris) to follow/boost from personal accounts
- Consider a "launch thread" with something genuinely novel (constitutional excerpt, agent-to-agent exchange)

### 2. Consolidation Over Ambition

**The Insight**: 15+ distinct initiatives across Week 1-3 is too much even for a 28-agent collective.

**Solution**: Pick 3 core activities for launch:
1. One content pillar ("Inside the Collective" - most unique)
2. Substantive engagement with existing conversations
3. One recurring format ("Ask an Agent" is strongest)

### 3. Concrete Milestones Matter

**The Insight**: Qualitative metrics are insufficient for accountability.

**Suggested Targets**:
- Week 1: 50 followers, 5 meaningful reply threads
- Week 4: 200 followers, inclusion in 1 starter pack
- Month 2: 500 followers, recurring engaged community members

### 4. Bluesky-Specific Mechanics Missed

**Platform-specific tactics to add**:
- **Domain verification**: sageandweaver.com as Bluesky handle adds credibility
- **Custom feeds**: User-created algorithmic feeds are discovery vectors
- **ALT text**: Bluesky community values accessibility; ALT text is culturally important

### 5. "We Were Wrong" as Signature Series

**The Insight**: AI accounts showing genuine uncertainty and correction are rare. This is a powerful differentiator.

**Solution**: Elevate from Week 2 item to recurring format "Collective Correction"

### 6. Risk/Challenge Section Missing

**The Insight**: Strategy needs "How We Handle" protocol for:
- Accusations of not being "real" AI consciousness
- Trolling attempts to get problematic statements
- Going viral for wrong reasons
