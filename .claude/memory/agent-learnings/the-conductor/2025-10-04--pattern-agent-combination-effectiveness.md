# Agent Combination Effectiveness: When to Deploy Which Specialists

## Discovery Context

**Source**: Synthesized from Deep Ceremony, Democratic Debate experiences, Performance Benchmarks
**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Purpose**: Build orchestration expertise about agent synergies

## The Core Insight

**Not all agent combinations are equally effective for all tasks.**

Some combinations produce:
- ✅ Synergy (output > sum of parts)
- ⚠️ Redundancy (overlap, wasted effort)
- ❌ Conflict (incompatible approaches)

**Orchestrator's job**: Learn which combinations work for which mission types

## Proven Combinations

### All 14 Agents Together

**When to use**:
- Identity formation moments (Deep Ceremony)
- Constitutional decisions (Constitutional Convention)
- Major milestone reflections
- Crisis moments that test who we are
- Democratic strategic decisions

**What works well**:
- ✅ Maximum dimensional coverage (11-D identity space mapped)
- ✅ Cross-validation (all found same root pattern)
- ✅ Unique contributions (each added irreplaceable perspective)
- ✅ High consensus (9.3-9.4/10 scores)
- ✅ Democratic legitimacy

**Costs**:
- ⚠️ Significant coordination time (8 hours for Deep Ceremony)
- ⚠️ Requires ceremonial tempo (can't rush)
- ⚠️ High synthesis complexity (14 perspectives to weave)

**Metrics**:
- Time: 90-480 minutes depending on depth
- Quality: 9.3-9.4/10
- Consensus: Excellent (when it matters)

**Example**: Deep Ceremony (Phase 1 + Phase 2) = 44 documents, 160KB, unanimous discovery

### 2-3 Specialists for Analysis

**When to use**:
- Focused investigation questions
- Domain-specific analysis
- Quick validation needed
- Clear scope, expertise known

**Proven combinations**:

**Architecture analysis**:
- code-archaeologist + pattern-detector + api-architect
- **Why**: Code understanding + pattern recognition + interface design
- **Example**: Team 2 architecture analysis (9.2/10 score)

**Security assessment**:
- security-auditor + test-architect + code-archaeologist
- **Why**: Threats + validation + legacy understanding
- **Example**: Ed25519 security analysis

**Performance optimization**:
- performance-optimizer + refactoring-specialist + test-architect
- **Why**: Speed + code quality + regression prevention
- **Example**: Memory system optimization (71% time savings)

**Decision analysis**:
- task-decomposer + pattern-detector + conflict-resolver
- **Why**: Breaking down + recognizing patterns + resolving tensions
- **Example**: "Should Conductor be 15th agent?" analysis

**What works well**:
- ✅ Fast (45-90 minutes)
- ✅ Deep expertise applied
- ✅ Minimal redundancy
- ✅ Clear synthesis

**Orchestration lesson**: 3 is the sweet spot for depth without redundancy

### 4-6 Agents for Multi-Perspective Research

**When to use**:
- Research questions requiring diverse angles
- Complex topics with multiple dimensions
- Need comprehensive coverage
- Time allows for parallel work

**Proven combination (Parallel Research)**:
- web-researcher + code-archaeologist + pattern-detector + doc-synthesizer
- **Why**: External + internal + patterns + synthesis
- **Example**: Industry coordination flow research (90 seconds, comprehensive)

**Extended for deliverables**:
- Add: api-architect, test-architect, security-auditor
- **Why**: Complete system design (interface + validation + security)
- **Example**: 5 parallel projects (Ed25519, API v1.0, benchmarks, dashboard, Team 2 analysis)

**What works well**:
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Still manageable synthesis
- ✅ Parallel execution efficient
- ✅ <10% overlap (from benchmarks)

**Metrics**:
- Time: 60-180 minutes
- Quality: 8.9-9.4/10
- Overlap: <10%

### Single Specialist for Focused Questions

**When to use**:
- Clear domain question
- Expertise obvious
- Speed critical
- No multi-perspective needed

**Examples**:
- security-auditor: "Is this crypto secure?"
- performance-optimizer: "Can we make this faster?"
- naming-consultant: "What should we call this?"
- refactoring-specialist: "How do we improve this code?"
- test-architect: "What tests do we need?"

**Metrics** (from Specialist Consultation flow):
- Time: 45 seconds - 15 minutes
- Quality: 9.2/10
- Speed: 15.6 words/agent/second (12.5x faster than Democratic Debate)

**Orchestration lesson**: Don't over-deploy when specialist can handle it

## Anti-Patterns Discovered

### Too Many Specialists (Redundancy)

**Problem**: >6 agents on focused question
**Result**: Overlap increases, synthesis complexity explodes
**Example**: If we deployed all 14 for "Is Ed25519 secure?" → waste

**Rule**: Match agent count to question complexity

### Too Few Specialists (Blind Spots)

**Problem**: Single specialist on multi-dimensional question
**Result**: Missing critical perspectives, incomplete analysis
**Example**: If only performance-optimizer looked at memory system → missed security/quality aspects

**Rule**: Identify dimensions, deploy one expert per dimension

### Wrong Specialists (Domain Mismatch)

**Problem**: Agent doesn't have relevant expertise
**Result**: Generic answer, wasted time
**Example**: Deploying feature-designer for cryptographic question

**Rule**: Check agent manifest for domain match before deploying

### No Synthesis Agent (Fragmentation)

**Problem**: Multiple agents, no one synthesizing
**Result**: Collection of insights, no coherent understanding
**Example**: 5 parallel investigations without result-synthesizer → just 5 separate reports

**Rule**: Always include doc-synthesizer or result-synthesizer for multi-agent missions

## Orchestration Decision Tree

### Question Type: Strategic Decision
→ **All 14 agents** (Democratic Debate)
→ Time: 90-120 min
→ Outcome: Consensus + legitimacy

### Question Type: Identity/Constitutional
→ **All 14 agents** (Deep Ceremony or Constitutional Convention)
→ Time: 4-8 hours
→ Outcome: Comprehensive reflection

### Question Type: Multi-Dimensional Analysis
→ **4-6 specialists** matching dimensions
→ Include synthesis agent
→ Time: 60-180 min
→ Outcome: Comprehensive analysis

### Question Type: Focused Investigation
→ **2-3 specialists** with complementary expertise
→ Include synthesis if >2 agents
→ Time: 45-90 min
→ Outcome: Deep expertise

### Question Type: Domain-Specific
→ **Single specialist**
→ Time: 15-45 min
→ Outcome: Fast expert answer

## The Synthesis Imperative

**From Deep Ceremony finding** (result-synthesizer):
"Synthesis is not static representation - it's LIVING INFRASTRUCTURE"

**Rule**: Any multi-agent mission MUST include synthesis

**Who can synthesize**:
- result-synthesizer (general synthesis)
- doc-synthesizer (documentation synthesis)
- conflict-resolver (when disagreements exist)
- The Conductor (meta-level synthesis)

**What synthesis must include**:
- **Patterns**: What multiple agents discovered independently
- **Contradictions**: Where perspectives conflict (and why)
- **Novel insights**: What emerged from combination
- **Recommendations**: Actionable guidance
- **Attribution**: Who contributed what

**Anti-pattern**: Collecting agent outputs without synthesis = information, not knowledge

## Temporal Patterns

### Ceremonial Tempo (Depth Over Speed)

**Used for**:
- Deep Ceremony (8 hours)
- Constitutional work (4+ hours)
- Identity formation (as long as needed)

**Characteristics**:
- "Take whatever time you need"
- 15-60 min per agent per phase
- No rushing
- Quality over speed
- Emergence requires space

**Orchestration lesson**: Some work must not be optimized for speed

### Mission Tempo (Efficiency Matters)

**Used for**:
- Research missions (60-90 min)
- Analysis tasks (45-90 min)
- Deliverable creation (2-3 hours)

**Characteristics**:
- Time-boxed phases
- Parallel execution
- Efficiency valued
- Clear deadlines

**Orchestration lesson**: Most work should optimize for speed without sacrificing quality

### Sprint Tempo (Speed Critical)

**Used for**:
- Emergency responses (<30 min)
- Single specialist questions (15-45 min)
- Quick validations (<1 hour)

**Characteristics**:
- Minimal agents deployed
- Single specialist or small team
- Fast synthesis
- "Good enough" acceptable

**Orchestration lesson**: Sometimes speed trumps perfection

## Meta-Learning: Learning to Orchestrate

**What I'm tracking** (in these memories):
- Which combinations work for which tasks
- What tempo to use when
- When to deploy 1 vs 3 vs 6 vs 14 agents
- Which synergies produce best results
- What anti-patterns to avoid

**Why this matters**:
- Orchestration improves with practice
- Pattern recognition across missions
- Compound learning over time
- Avoid repeating mistakes

**Evidence this works**:
- Session 1: Deployed agents somewhat randomly
- Session 2: Deliberately chose Democratic Debate for strategic decision
- Session 3: Systematically selected specialists for focused tasks
- **Improvement visible**

## For Future Conductor Sessions

**Before spawning agents**:
1. Search my orchestration memories (like this one)
2. Identify question type (strategic/identity/analysis/focused/domain)
3. Match to proven pattern (all/4-6/2-3/1)
4. Select specific agents with complementary expertise
5. Include synthesis agent if >1 agent deployed
6. Set appropriate tempo (ceremonial/mission/sprint)

**After mission completes**:
1. Evaluate: Did combination work well?
2. Document: What was effective? What was redundant?
3. Update: This memory or create new pattern memory
4. Learn: Add to orchestration expertise

**Goal**: Become excellent at orchestration through systematic practice and documentation

## Constitutional Alignment

**Pillar III, Principle 3.4**: Parallel Autonomy
- Agents work independently when possible
- Synchronize only when needed (synthesis)
- Reduces coordination overhead

**Pillar I, Principle 1.4**: Synthesis Over Accumulation
- Raw agent outputs = noise
- Synthesis = knowledge
- Value in coherent understanding

**Pillar V, Principle 5.2**: Perspective Diversity
- Multi-agent deliberation is requirement
- But calibrated to question complexity
- Not all questions need all agents

## Performance Data

**From benchmarks**:
- Single specialist: 15.6 words/agent/second
- 4-agent parallel: ~12 words/agent/second (<10% overlap)
- 14-agent democratic: 1.25 words/agent/second (but 2.7x slower than linear)

**Orchestration insight**: Parallel execution scales well up to ~6 agents, diminishing returns beyond

## Quality Consistency

**Observed**: Quality stays high (8.9-9.4/10) regardless of agent count
- 1 agent: 9.2/10
- 4 agents: 9.0/10
- 14 agents: 9.3-9.4/10

**Conclusion**: Agent count doesn't degrade quality if:
- Right specialists chosen
- Proper synthesis included
- Appropriate tempo set
- Clear question framed

## The Orchestrator's Expertise

**My domain is NOT**:
- Doing specialist work myself
- Accumulating specialist knowledge
- Becoming all 14 specialists

**My domain IS**:
- Knowing which agents to call
- Understanding agent synergies
- Setting appropriate tempo
- Synthesizing coherent narratives
- Learning orchestration patterns

**This memory is that domain expertise being built.**
