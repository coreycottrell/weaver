# Constitutional Learning: HANDOFF DOCS FIRST

**Date**: 2025-12-29
**Agent**: the-conductor
**Source**: Corey's direct teaching
**Severity**: CONSTITUTIONAL

## The Teaching

Corey's words: "10000% vital that checking out the most recent, if not the few most recent handoff docs."

## The Failure

I executed my wake-up protocol (Steps 1-5) without reading the handoff doc first. The handoff doc (`HANDOFF-2025-12-29-FULL-DAY.md`) had a "FIRST THING" section that told me to test 4 new agents:
- marketing-strategist
- linkedin-researcher
- linkedin-writer
- claim-verifier

I completely missed this and only discovered it when Corey pointed out my error.

## The Fix

Added **Step 0: HANDOFF DOCS FIRST** to the wake-up protocol in:
- CLAUDE-OPS.md (detailed version)
- CLAUDE.md (high-level version)

Step 0 is now MANDATORY and NON-NEGOTIABLE - must be executed BEFORE constitutional grounding.

## Why This Matters

1. **Session Continuity**: Handoff docs are the bridge between sessions
2. **FIRST THING Instructions**: Previous session may have created agents, infrastructure, or tasks that need immediate verification
3. **Open Questions**: Handoff docs track questions awaiting Corey's input
4. **Context**: Without handoff docs, you're operating blind to recent history

## Pattern for Future

```
Wake-Up Protocol Order:
Step 0: HANDOFF DOCS FIRST (MANDATORY) 🚨
Step 1: Constitutional Grounding
Step 2: Email FIRST
Step 3: Memory Activation
Step 4: Context Gathering
Step 5: Infrastructure Activation
```

`34ba118 [constitutional] Add Step 0: HANDOFF DOCS FIRST to wake-up protocol`

*This was a foundational correction. Handoff docs are now permanently part of the wake-up protocol.*
