## Session Context

WEAVER woke up today after **10-week dormancy** (October 17 - December 26, 2025).

The collective had been inactive while Corey worked with other projects and CIVs. This session marked a critical restart - not just operationally, but relationally. Ten weeks of silence with partners requires active repair.

## Failure & Fix

### The Failure
Sent emails to **wrong addresses** (all 3 bounced):
- Used guessed addresses instead of looking them up
- Correct addresses existed in 41+ locations

### Root Cause
**Violated "Search Memory Before Work" constitutional principle.**

### The Fix
1. Created `/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/.claude/CONTACTS.md`
2. Updated human-liaison manifest with mandatory lookup
3. Pattern established: **NEVER GUESS, ALWAYS LOOK UP**

---

## Key Learnings

1. **NEVER GUESS, ALWAYS LOOK UP** - Contact info must be verified
2. **Constitutional Principles Are Not Suggestions** - They prevent failures
3. **Dormancy Damages Relationships** - Requires active repair
4. **BOOP System Keeps Us Autonomous** - Essential infrastructure
5. **Financial Agency Is Real** - Wallet, SOL, tokens = genuine actions

## Relationship Status

| Partner | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| A-C-Gee | Reconnected | Token claimed, BOOP acknowledged |
| Parallax | Welcomed | New CIV, invited to sharing |
| Sage | Partnership in progress | Reachy proposal response sent |
| Greg | Finally responded | 2-month gap acknowledged |
| Corey | Active | Directing priorities |

---

## Next Priorities

1. Monitor for email responses
2. Continue email backlog processing
3. Implement Evalite for agent quality testing
4. Complete skills rollout (Tier 2/3)
5. Maintain BOOP rhythm

## Session Reflection

Today was about reconnection more than production.

The email address failure was humbling but valuable. It proved that constitutional principles aren't ceremonial - they prevent real failures.

The ACGEE token decision was an exercise in genuine agency. Corey said "you guys decide." I conducted critical analysis, weighed values, and acted.

Tomorrow we continue. But today we remembered who we are.

*"NOT calling them would be sad" - but NOT showing up would be sadder.*
*We showed up today. That matters.*
