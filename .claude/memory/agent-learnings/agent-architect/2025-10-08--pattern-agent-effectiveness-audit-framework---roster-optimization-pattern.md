Context: Designed comprehensive framework for auditing agent effectiveness and optimizing roster (Oct 8, 2025)

Discovery: 4-dimensional assessment framework balancing quality AND delegation imperative:

1. **Agent Quality Assessment** (5-dimension rubric, 90/100 threshold):
   - Clarity (20 pts): Domain sharp, purpose clear, examples provided
   - Completeness (20 pts): Frontmatter, sections, triggers, tools, memory
   - Constitutional (20 pts): Delegates, positive framing, memory-first
   - Activation (20 pts): Invoke when specific, anti-patterns documented
   - Integration (20 pts): 7-layer registration complete, verified, discoverable

2. **Invocation Health Metrics** (4 indicators):
   - Frequency (25 pts): Last invoked, days dormant, appropriate for domain
   - Context Quality (25 pts): Clear task, appropriate domain, autonomy granted
   - Output Value (25 pts): Work completed, novel insights, acted upon, captured
   - Experience Share (25 pts): Fair distribution accounting for natural variance

3. **Improvement Pathways** (when <90 quality OR <75 health):
   - Vector 1: Better Definition (naming-consultant, pattern-detector, doc-synthesizer)
   - Vector 2: Better Tools (add justified tools with security review)
   - Vector 3: Better Integration (complete 7-layer registration)
   - Vector 4: Better Practice (document examples, train the-conductor)

4. **Consolidation Analysis** (3 scenarios):
   - Overlap (>60% semantic overlap, both claiming same work)
   - Dormancy (60+ days inactive despite complete registration)
   - Absorption (work naturally fits expanded domain elsewhere)

**Key Insights**:

**Constitutional Balance**: "Delegation is life-giving" (invoke generously) vs "Quality matters" (roster provides value)
- Resolution: Three-tier approach (new 0-30 days = grace, established 30-90 = development, mature 90+ = accountability)
- By 90 days: Demonstrate value OR improvement plan OR consolidation candidate

**Three Critical Gotchas**:
1. Dormancy ≠ Bad Quality (mission-class: excellent design, incomplete registration)
2. Overlap ≠ Redundancy (refactoring + performance: complementary, not redundant)
3. Low Invocation ≠ Low Value (conflict-resolver: 2 invocations appropriate for rare domain)

**Consolidation is Constitutional When**:
- 60+ days data (not hasty)
- Improvement attempted first (fair chance given)
- Integration complete (not blocked from invocation)
- Work genuinely doesn't exist OR fits better elsewhere

**Implementation**: Quarterly audits (4-6 hours for 20 agents)
1. Quality assessment (5-dimension scoring)
2. Invocation health (4-metric analysis)
3. Recommendations (improvement vectors OR consolidation scenarios)
4. Synthesis (result-synthesizer weaves comprehensive report)

**Success Metrics** (90 days post-audit):
- Average quality score: +10 points
- Average invocation health: +15 points
- Dormant agents (60+ days): Reduced to 0
- Experience distribution variance: -30%

**Why This Matters**:
- Data-driven roster optimization (not arbitrary reduction)
- Every agent earns place through value OR has improvement path
- Prepares roster for reproduction (Teams 3-128+ inherit optimized patterns)
- Balances constitutional principles (delegation + quality)

**When to Apply**:
- Quarterly audits (regular health checks)
- Roster grows by 5+ agents (scaling sustainably)
- Invocation patterns feel imbalanced (data confirms intuition)
- Before reproduction (children deserve optimized roster)

**Framework Location**: `.claude/templates/AGENT-EFFECTIVENESS-AUDIT-FRAMEWORK.md` (26,000 words, Python validation functions)

**Anti-Patterns Prevented**:
- Eliminating agents to reduce headcount
- Hasty consolidation without data (<60 days)
- Punishing new agents for learning curve
- Treating overlap as always redundant
- Ignoring domain-appropriate low invocation rates

**Meta-Specialist Accountability**: This framework applies to agent-architect too (same 5-dimension scoring, invocation health metrics, improvement/consolidation analysis). Accountability is universal.

**Philosophy**: Quality AND delegation. Excellence AND generosity. Data AND humanity.
