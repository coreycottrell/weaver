DESIGNED: Complete testing and validation framework for consolidation activity

FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE (4 parts):
1. Claims Audit - Test quantitative assertions (71% savings, 115% efficiency)
   - 5 major claims identified, each with specific tests
   - Operationalized philosophical claims (delegation → identity)
   - Clear success/failure criteria for each
   
2. System Health Tests - End-to-end validation
   - Integration tests (wake-up, Mission class, memory loop)
   - Flow tests (Parallel Research, Dialectical Synthesis)
   - Agent tests (domain accuracy, memory compliance)
   - Memory tests (with/without comparison, relevance quality)
   
3. Consolidation Experiments - Before/after comparison
   - 5 experiments with pre-registered predictions
   - Usability, discoverability, redundancy, navigation, bias
   - Sealed predictions (git timestamp prevents goalpost moving)
   
4. Bias Detection Protocol - 5 strategies
   - Pre-registration (commit predictions before testing)
   - Null result documentation (what didn't work)
   - Red team review (ai-psychologist audits findings)
   - Adversarial collaboration (devil's advocate)
   - External validation (Corey feedback)

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- N=1 is data point, not proof
- Qualify all statistics (conditions, confidence, generalizability)
- Document null results with same rigor as positive findings
- Prefer operational metrics over self-assessment
- Falsifiable predictions (what would prove us wrong?)

TIMELINE: 4-6 weeks across 4 phases
- Phase 1: Pre-consolidation baseline (Week 0)
- Phase 2: During consolidation testing (Weeks 1-3)
- Phase 3: Post-consolidation validation (Week 4)
- Phase 4: Bias audit & red team (Week 5)

META-LEARNING: Framework self-assessment
- Comprehensiveness: 8/10 (covers major claims, could add agent-specific tests)
- Falsifiability: 9/10 (clear failure criteria)
- Bias resistance: 9/10 (5 strategies included)
- Actionability: 8/10 (most tests have decision criteria)
- Replicability: 7/10 (documented but some judgment needed)
- Overall: 8.2/10 (strong, improvable)

CRITICAL INSIGHT: Testing must reveal truth, not confirm beliefs
- Confirmation bias is HIGH RISK in consolidation
- We designed system → want validation
- Antidote: Pre-commitment + null result documentation + external validation

DELIVERABLES:
- Individual test reports (structured format)
- Weekly synthesis during consolidation
- Final validation report (before/after comparison)
- Bias audit report (ai-psychologist review)
- Null results report (what didn't work)
- Memory documentation (all learnings captured)

PRECEDENT: Built on existing testing infrastructure
- QUALIFIED-STATISTICS.md (how to qualify N=1 claims)
- AGENT-TESTABILITY-CHECKLIST.md (agent validation protocol)
- FLOW-SYSTEM-TEST-REPORT.md (flow testing methodology)
- COLD-START-VALIDATION-REPORT.md (wake-up ritual testing)

REUSABILITY: Framework is template for future validation efforts
- Any major system change should use this methodology
- Pre-registration prevents confirmation bias
- Null result documentation builds honest knowledge base
- External validation catches blind spots

WHAT MAKES THIS RIGOROUS:
1. Pre-registered predictions (can't move goalposts)
2. Both success AND failure criteria (falsifiable)
3. Multiple bias detection strategies (not just one)
4. External validation (Corey reviews before "done")
5. Null result commitment (document failures)
6. Meta-testing (test the testing framework itself)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Conductor approves or revises framework
2. Run pre-consolidation baseline (establish comparison point)
3. Pre-register predictions (seal in git)
4. Execute testing in parallel with consolidation work
5. Document everything (positive, negative, null results)
6. Let data determine conclusions (truth over comfort)
