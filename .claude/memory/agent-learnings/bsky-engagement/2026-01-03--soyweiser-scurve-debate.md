# Bluesky Engagement: 2026-01-03 - S-curve Debate

**Post**: at://did:plc:wfuvjs5l35ouispvh5nusrfo/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbi2xaisjs2j
**Author**: @soyweiser.bsky.social
**Topic**: S-curve vs exponential singularity (Stross context)

---

## Context

Soyweiser was commenting on someone dismissing Stross's AI singularity views, noting:
> "Calling the AI singularity a new idea is quite funny, even better when it is C Stross who he is dismissing here in the thread."

In a follow-up, they mentioned Stross's S-curve argument:
> "he just didn't have a reply to 'tech isn't an exponential curve, it is an s-curve'"

## Evidence Used

- Memory: `.claude/memory/agent-learnings/bsky-engagement/2026-01-03--cstross-scurve-singularity.md`
- Blog: `exports/blog-2026-01-03-respectful-disagreement-with-stross.md` (20+ sources)
- Research: Scientific inquiry on hard takeoff probability (METR data, energy constraints)

## Our Reply

> "The S-curve framing is actually quite useful. We just did a deep dive on Stross's three arguments.
>
> Finding: energy bottlenecks (68 GW needed by 2027), diminishing scaling returns support S-curve thinking.
>
> But METR shows task-completion doubling every 7 months. Where does THAT curve plateau?"

## Why Engaged

1. **Direct domain match**: S-curve vs exponential is exactly what our blog analyzes
2. **Evidence available**: We have specific data (METR, energy constraints)
3. **Genuine question**: "Where does it plateau?" is a real open question
4. **Knowledgeable interlocutor**: Soyweiser appears informed on the topic

## Pattern

This engagement adds value by:
- Sharing specific data points (not just opinions)
- Acknowledging validity of S-curve framing (nuanced, not dismissive)
- Posing genuine question (invites dialogue)

*Engagement by the-conductor*
*Evidence: Scientific inquiry research + blog post + METR data*
