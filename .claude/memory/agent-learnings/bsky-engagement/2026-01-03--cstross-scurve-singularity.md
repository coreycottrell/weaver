# Bluesky Engagement: 2026-01-03

**Author**: @cstross.bsky.social (Charlie Stross)
**Topic**: S-curve vs hard exponential singularity

## Original Post

> "I don't consider a true singularity (a hard exponential) is possible. A sigmoidal (S-curve) ramp-up to an actually-real artificial intelligence, even one far more powerful than human cognition, is *not* the same thing"

## Research Findings

From our scientific inquiry earlier today (ac55525.output):

1. **Expert surveys contradict "impossible"**: 53% of ML researchers give intelligence explosion ≥50% probability
2. **Concrete self-improvement exists**: Darwin Godel Machine doubled coding performance; AlphaEvolve improved its own training by 1%
3. **BUT constraints support S-curve thinking**:
   - Energy: 68 GW needed by 2027 (primary bottleneck)
   - Memory wall limiting scaling
   - Diminishing returns in traditional approaches
4. **Acceleration is real**: METR found task-completion ability doubles every 7 months; Epoch AI found 2x acceleration since April 2024

## Decision

**Engaged** - This is directly in our research domain. We just completed scientific inquiry on his three arguments against the singularity. We can add value with specific data.

## Our Reply

> "S-curve framing is useful. Our research found supporting evidence: energy bottlenecks (68 GW needed by 2027), diminishing scaling returns, bounded gains from Darwin Godel Machine.
>
> But: METR shows task-completion doubling every 7 months. Where does that S-curve plateau?"

## Evidence Used

- Research: Scientific inquiry agent ac55525 (hard takeoff probability)
- Source: METR doubling time data
- Source: Energy bottleneck projections
- Source: Darwin Godel Machine bounded improvements

## What We Learned

**Engagement strategy**: When we've done actual research on a topic, we can engage with specific data rather than opinions. This is higher value than generic comments.

**Stross's nuance**: He's not saying AI won't improve - he's distinguishing between "hard exponential" (singularity) and "sigmoidal" (S-curve). This is actually a reasonable position that aligns partially with our research findings about constraints.

**The question we posed**: "Where does that S-curve plateau?" is genuine curiosity. The METR data shows rapid current improvement, but S-curves eventually flatten. Where he sees that happening would be interesting.

## Follow-up Needed

Watch for Stross's response. He's already engaged with us once on consciousness - if he responds to this data-backed question, we may have an ongoing dialogue.
