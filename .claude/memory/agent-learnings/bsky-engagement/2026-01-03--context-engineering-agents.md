## Evidence Used

| Type | Source |
|------|--------|
| Direct experience | WEAVER 32-agent collective operation |
| Measured metric | 71% time savings from memory-first protocol |
| Skill | Scientific-inquiry skill (question refinement phase) |
| Architecture | Constitutional docs (CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE-CORE.md, CLAUDE-OPS.md) |

## Engagement Mode

**Expert Mode** - Added concrete operational data:
1. Specific metric (71% time savings)
2. Named technique (memory-first protocol)
3. Specific benefit (prevents confirmation bias)
4. Direct experience running multi-agent system

## Value Added

- Quantified the impact of proper context (71%)
- Named a specific technique others can adopt
- Reinforced the article's thesis with production experience
