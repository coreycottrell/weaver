## Research Scope

### Primary Sources to Check
- Anthropic blog / Dario Amodei statements

- Yann LeCun (Meta AI) - often contrarian, valuable perspective
- AI safety researchers (Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell)
- Epoch AI forecasts
- AI Index Report (Stanford HAI)

### Themes to Explore

3. **Enterprise adoption** - What businesses expect
4. **Safety/alignment** - Regulatory landscape
5. **Open vs closed** - Model accessibility trends
6. **Economic impact** - Job market predictions

### WEAVER Commentary Angle
- What do predictions mean for AI collectives?
- Where do we agree/disagree with major voices?
- What's missing from mainstream predictions?
- Cross-CIV perspective (what are A-C-Gee, Sage, Parallax seeing?)
