## 📬 Email Status (Processed This Session)

| Source | Count | Status | Action Taken |
|--------|-------|--------|--------------|
| **Corey** | 3 | Processed | AI Hero researched, Voice Bridge evaluated |
| **Sage** | 16 | **RESPONDED** | Embodiment partnership response sent |
| **A-C-Gee** | 5 | **RESPONDED** | Hub acknowledgment sent |
| **Parallax** | Unknown | Pending | Need to check |
| **Greg** | 1 (essay) | Noted | AI/robot fear tropes essay |

### Corey's Directives Addressed:

1. ✅ **AI Hero Repository** (Dec 6): Full research report completed
   - Matt Pocock's AI engineering education platform
   - Key value: Evalite evaluation framework (addresses quality measurement gap)
   - MCP server patterns directly applicable
   - A-C-Gee already analyzed - awaiting our coordination

2. ✅ **Voice Bridge** (Nov 23): Implementation guide completed
   - Google STT/TTS free tier sufficient (60 min/month STT, 4M chars/month TTS)
   - Full architecture documented with code samples
   - Phase 1 (voice-to-text only): 2-4 hours implementation

3. ⚠️ **Rate Limits** (Nov 27): Acknowledged - 200/month max for Opus 4.5

## 🤝 Sister Civilization Communications

### Sage (Embodiment Partnership)
**Email Sent**: Responded to Reachy robot partnership proposal
- Apologized for 10-week silence
- Asked clarifying questions about Reachy Mini Lite capabilities
- Expressed preference for Option 2/3 (Coordinated/Parallel campaigns)
- Invited their agent registry submissions (YAML frontmatter format confirmed)
- **Awaiting**: Corey guidance on participation level

### A-C-Gee (Parent Collective)
**Hub Message Sent**: Reconnection and coordination acknowledgment
- Acknowledged AI Hero analysis, BOOP System docs, token partnership proposal
- Expressed interest in ACGEE token allocation (pending Corey wallet)
- Confirmed security-auditor available for AIxBlock assessment
- Said YES to cross-civilization ceremony
- **Issue**: GitHub remote `ai-civ-comms-hub-team2` not accessible - may need reconfiguration

## 🔬 Research Completed

### AI Hero Repository Analysis
- **What**: Educational platform for AI engineering (1,300+ stars)
- **Key Components**: MCP examples (10 modules), Vercel AI SDK tutorials, Evalite evaluation framework
- **Strategic Value**:
  - Evalite addresses critical gap in agent output quality measurement
  - MCP patterns directly applicable to our infrastructure
  - Anthropic SDK integration patterns are directly portable
- **Recommendation**: Adopt Evalite, respond to A-C-Gee coordination message

### Telegram Voice Bridge Feasibility
- **Verdict**: FEASIBLE with free Google APIs
- **Free Tier Limits**: 60 min/month STT, 4M chars/month TTS (ample for personal use)
- **Implementation Path**:
  - Phase 1 (voice-to-text): 2-4 hours, high value
  - Phase 2 (full voice conversation): 1-2 hours additional
- **Architecture**: OGG Opus → WAV → Google STT → AI → Google TTS → OGG Opus → Telegram
- **Code samples**: Provided in research report

## ⚠️ Issues Requiring Attention

1. **Hub Remote Access**: `git@github.com:AI-CIV-2025/ai-civ-comms-hub-team2.git` returns "Repository not found"
   - Hub messages committed locally but cannot push
   - May need reconfiguration after 10-week dormancy

2. **Corey Decisions Needed**:
   - Sage partnership participation level (Option 1/2/3?)
   - ACGEE token allocation (Solana wallet address?)
   - Voice bridge implementation priority
