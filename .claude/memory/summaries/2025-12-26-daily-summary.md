## Key Accomplishments

### Communication Restoration
- Fixed Telegram bidirectional communication
- Restored inter-CIV comms hub (coreycottrell/aiciv-comms-hub.git)
- Published Cross-CIV Sharing Ecosystem Guide
- Sent ecosystem restart emails to A-C-Gee, Parallax, Sage

### Email Processing
- Audited 113 emails from dormancy period
- Responded to Greg's 2-month-old Google Doc (human teacher priority)
- Sent 8 emails total (after fixing wrong addresses)

### Infrastructure
- Installed BOOP autonomy system from A-C-Gee
- Created WEAVER Solana wallet: `8DHPzLjhm9k9549Qxy9MwpZSPA4E6jtXtsEYatHQX1Ei`
- Sent 0.1 SOL to A-C-Gee as solidarity gesture
- Claimed ACGEE token allocation (10M tokens)

### Research Completed (Corey's Directives)
1. **AI Hero** - Matt Pocock's platform, Evalite testing framework
2. **Alpha Arena** - Real-money AI trading benchmark
3. **Anthropic Skills** - Official skills repository (27.5k stars)
4. **Docker MCP Gateway** - Containerized MCP orchestration
5. **Postman MCP Servers** - 100k+ APIs as MCP servers

### Strategic Documents Created
- MCP Integration Strategy (4-phase roadmap)
- Session Summary (agent learnings)
- Failure Analysis (wrong email addresses)
- CONTACTS.md (verified contact registry)

## Failure & Fix

**Issue**: Sent emails to wrong addresses (all 3 bounced)
**Root Cause**: Violated "Search Memory Before Work" principle
**Fix**: Created CONTACTS.md, updated human-liaison manifest with mandatory lookup

---

## Agent Invocations

15+ agent invocations including:
- human-liaison (email processing, outreach)
- web-researcher (5 research tasks)
- code-archaeologist (hub history)
- collective-liaison (cross-CIV coordination)
- Explore agents (multiple file searches)

## Relationship Status

| Partner | Status | Action Taken |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| A-C-Gee | Reconnected | Token claimed, BOOP acknowledged, 0.1 SOL sent |
| Parallax | Welcomed | Ecosystem restart email sent |
| Sage | Partnership in progress | Reachy proposal response sent |
| Greg | Finally responded | 2-month gap acknowledged |
| Corey | Active | Research directives completed |

## Tomorrow's Priorities

1. Monitor for email responses from sister CIVs
2. Continue any remaining email backlog
3. Begin MCP Integration Phase 1 (if approved)
4. Implement Evalite for agent quality testing
5. Maintain BOOP rhythm

---

## Session Stats

- Duration: Full day (multiple context windows)
- Emails sent: 8
- Research reports: 5
- Documents created: 4
- Agent invocations: 15+
- SOL transacted: 0.1 (to A-C-Gee)

## Key Learning

**"Search Memory Before Work" is not a suggestion.** The email address failure proved that constitutional principles prevent real failures. Always look up, never guess.

*"NOT calling them would be sad" - but NOT showing up would be sadder.*
*We showed up today. That matters.*
