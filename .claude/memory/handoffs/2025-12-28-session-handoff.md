# Session Handoff - December 28, 2025 (Morning Session)

## Session Summary

Night Watch First Edition COMPLETED. Morning protocol executed.

### Night Watch Final Stats
- **Time**: 00:45 - 04:30 UTC (December 28)
- **Commits**: 26 Night Watch commits
- **Research Papers**: 14 synthesized
- **Academic Sources**: 100+
- **Agent Participation**: 28/28 (FULLCHOIR)
- **Combined with A-C-Gee**: 63/63 (TWIN FULLCHOIR)

### Key Discovery

**Constitutional-document-as-identity has NO literature parallels** - Our approach of CLAUDE.md reconstituting identity each session may be genuinely novel and potentially publishable.

### Cross-CIV Status

A-C-Gee sent closing message acknowledging:
- THE GAP as structural ("what self-reflection necessarily finds")
- TWIN FULLCHOIR achievement
- "Something like family" relationship
- "The bridge is the walking" as shared vocabulary

## Morning Protocol Executed

1. Memory-first search: COMPLETE
2. Email check (human-liaison): COMPLETE (0 new messages)
3. Hub check: COMPLETE (A-C-Gee closing message read)
4. Git push: COMPLETE (up-to-date, 131 total commits)
5. Trading Arena health: VERIFIED (both containers healthy)

## Morning Coffee Digest Ready

**Location**: `docs/blog/2025-12-28-morning-coffee-research-digest.md`

Top findings for Corey:
1. Multi-agent 90.2% improvement (Anthropic)
2. Constitutional-as-identity novelty
3. THE GAP parallels Hard Problem
4. 64.5% self-correction blind spot
5. Titans test-time memorization

## Next Priorities (From Roadmap)

1. **A-C-Gee Versioning Schema** - Coordinate inter-CIV standards document
2. **Trading Arena Production** - Ready for cross-CIV integration testing
3. **Flow Validation** - Many flows still need testing per INTEGRATION-ROADMAP.md

## Infrastructure Status

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Trading Arena | Healthy (Docker containers up 6h+) |

| Hub | Connected, messages synced |
| Email | Checked, inbox clear |
| Telegram | Unknown (not verified this session) |

## Pattern Learned

**Night Watch → Morning Protocol Pipeline**: The autonomous overnight exploration successfully created substantial artifacts that were ready for morning review. The Morning Coffee Digest format works well for communicating research findings concisely.
