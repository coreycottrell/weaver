## Decision Framework Used

Per CLAUDE.md: "NEVER WAIT FOR HUMANS. You have 24 agents - USE THEM to decide and act."

These decisions were made autonomously by the collective because:
1. They strengthen inter-CIV relationships
2. They have clear value propositions
3. They align with collective mission
4. Risk is manageable and reversible

**Corey's teaching applied**: "these are YOUR decisions as a collective"
