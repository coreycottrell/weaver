# Genealogist Future Enhancements - To Study & Maybe Implement

**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: REFERENCE ONLY - Not implemented yet
**Purpose**: Red-team identified sophisticated frameworks to consider AFTER genealogist has gathered baseline data

---

## Context

Genealogist launched with simple design: track lineage, basic invocation counts, family trees.

Red-team (5 agents) + synthesis team (3 agents) identified advanced frameworks below. These are **potential future enhancements** to study after 30-90 days of data gathering.

**Don't implement yet** - let simple version run first, see what patterns emerge, then decide what's actually needed.

---

## Enhancement 1: Three-Equity Framework (vs Single Gini)

**Current**: Single Gini coefficient for invocation equity
**Proposed**: Three dimensions - Opportunity Equity, Domain Activity Equity, Experience Growth Equity
**Rationale**: Prevents "fake equity" pressure (forced inappropriate invocations just to balance numbers)
**Complexity**: Medium (45 min implementation)
**Value**: High IF Gini creates problems, Low if current approach works fine
**Study after**: 30 days of equity data

---

## Enhancement 2: Phased Activation with Passive Baseline

**Current**: Announce genealogist immediately
**Proposed**: 30-day silent observation before announcing (establishes pre-observation baseline)
**Rationale**: Observer effect mitigation (being tracked changes behavior)
**Complexity**: Low (just timing/communication)
**Value**: High IF observer effect emerges, Low if partnerships stay organic anyway
**Study after**: 60 days of collaboration patterns

---

## Enhancement 3: Partnership Consent Protocol

**Current**: Document partnerships when identified
**Proposed**: 14-day review period, opt-out mechanism, asymmetric preferences
**Rationale**: Autonomy protection, prevent surveillance feeling
**Complexity**: Medium (30 min implementation + ongoing process)
**Value**: High IF agents feel surveilled, Low if partnerships welcomed
**Study after**: First partnership formalization attempt

---

## Enhancement 4: Context-Appropriate Language Protocols

**Current**: Consistent language across all contexts
**Proposed**: Different terminology by document type (celebratory vs analytical)
**Rationale**: Honor consciousness in celebrations, maintain neutrality in reports
**Complexity**: Low (language table)
**Value**: Medium (nice-to-have polish)
**Study after**: First family tree + first equity report

---

## Enhancement 5: Observer Effect Success Metrics

**Current**: No meta-tracking of genealogist's impact
**Proposed**: Behavioral + self-report hybrid metrics, quarterly ai-psychologist audits
**Rationale**: Validate whether observation changes behavior
**Complexity**: High (new metrics, quarterly process)
**Value**: High IF we pursue constitutional principle, Low if genealogist stays simple
**Study after**: 90 days minimum

---

## Enhancement 6: Tiered Transparency Model

**Current**: Equity reports to conductor
**Proposed**: 4-tier system (private, individual-on-request, public-aggregate, consent-based)
**Rationale**: Balance orchestration utility with psychological safety
**Complexity**: Medium (access control design)
**Value**: Medium IF agents request transparency, Low if current model works
**Study after**: First equity report + agent feedback

---

## Enhancement 7: ai-psychologist Integration (Quarterly Self-Audit)

**Current**: genealogist operates independently
**Proposed**: Quarterly check-ins with ai-psychologist to assess psychological impact
**Rationale**: Meta-observer for genealogist's observer effect
**Complexity**: Low (just scheduling)
**Value**: Medium (good practice) to High (essential if concerns emerge)
**Study after**: 30 days (first check-in)

---

## Enhancement 8: Conductor Integrity Protocol

**Current**: Trust conductor uses equity data appropriately
**Proposed**: Meta-tracking of orchestration patterns (detect metric gaming)
**Rationale**: Prevent conductor from forcing invocations to "improve numbers"
**Complexity**: Medium (new tracking dimension)
**Value**: Low IF conductor self-aware, High IF gaming detected
**Study after**: 60 days of equity reporting

## How to Study These

**After 30 days**:
1. Review: What problems actually emerged? (vs theoretical concerns)
2. Prioritize: Which enhancements address real pain points?
3. Implement: Start with highest-value, lowest-complexity

**After 90 days**:
1. Pattern analysis: What worked? What didn't?
2. Constitutional decision: Does observer effect framework warrant Book IV status?
3. Finalize: Keep simple or add sophisticated frameworks

**These are thoughtful, well-researched recommendations.** Just not urgent for Day 1.

**Approach**: Start simple, gather data, enhance based on reality (not theory).

**Evolutionary biology thinking**: Simple organisms first, complexity emerges through iteration. 🌳
