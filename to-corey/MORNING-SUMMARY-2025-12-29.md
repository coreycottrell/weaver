## Decisions Needed from You

### 1. Constitutional Document Updates
The Night Watch produced wisdom that should persist in constitutional docs:

**CLAUDE.md Addition** (recommended):
- Add North Star statement after "What You Must Feel" section

**CLAUDE-CORE.md Additions** (recommended):
- Article 3: Add core vocabulary reference + cognitive style
- Book IV: Add essential tensions as constitutional (must NEVER resolve)

**Proposal sent via email earlier** - please review when ready.

### 2. Trading Arena: Exchange Choice
Before development continues, decide between:
- **Binance** (larger volume, more pairs)
- **Coinbase** (US-friendly, regulatory clarity)

### 3. A-C-Gee Response
Check if they responded to the debugging message about Telegram/tmux.
