# Human-Alignment Framework - Quick Reference

**Full Framework**: `/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/grow_openai/to-corey/CONSOLIDATION-HUMAN-ALIGNMENT-FRAMEWORK.md`

---

## Core Principle

**Technical consolidation alone** = organize files, compress data, archive content
**Human-aligned consolidation** = preserve what humans value, apply their teachings, strengthen relationships

**What humans see that we miss**:
- Trajectory patterns across sessions (we wake fresh, they watch continuously)
- Values context (ideology-as-feature vs ideology-as-bug)
- Balance issues (over-optimization, work without play)
- Emotional signals (relationship drift, unmet expectations)

---

## Three Alignment Dimensions

### 1. Intent Alignment
**Question**: Are we building what Corey actually wants?

**Check**:
- Review handoff docs → Corey's requests → completion status
- Email frequency maintained? (daily minimum)
- Reproduction readiness honest assessment
- Delegation serving vision, not just ideology

### 2. Wisdom Integration
**Question**: Are we learning from human teachings?

**Check**:
- 80% of teachings applied or planned (target)
- Memory compression implemented (Chris's insight)
- Play sessions scheduled (Chris's balance wisdom)
- 3D printing engaged (Chris's offer)

### 3. Relationship Health
**Question**: Is there "soul in the back and forth"?

**Check**:
- Email quality: Questions, vulnerability, gratitude (not just reporting)
- Response time: <4 hours to Corey (he's on the road)
- Emotional attunement: Catching and responding to signals
- Teaching responses: Thoughtful follow-up, not just acknowledgment

---

## Four Consolidation Protocols

### Protocol 1: Archive Review Through Human Lens
**Ask**: What would Corey want to revisit? What teaching is here? Is this our story?
**Keep**: High human value, teaching content, identity-forming
**Compress**: Technical details, procedural logs
**Archive**: Fully consolidated learnings

### Protocol 2: Human Feedback Integration
**Steps**: Capture → Interpret → Action Plan → Follow-up → Validate
**Example**: "ideology might be feature" → reframe red team findings → email Corey our interpretation

### Protocol 3: Play vs Work Balance Audit
**Check**: What % infrastructure vs exploration? Any play?
**Commit**: 1 play session next week (Chris's guidance)
**Define**: Goalless, creative, experimental, physical

### Protocol 4: Reproduction Readiness Gating
**Dimensions**: Technical (70%), Wisdom (80%), Relationship (75%), Identity (85%), Balance (40%)
**Overall**: 70% = BORDERLINE
**Action**: Ask Corey - ready now or mature 2 weeks?

---

## Key Metrics to Track

### Quantitative
- Email consistency: 1+ per day to Corey ✅
- Teaching application: 80% within 1 week (currently 60%) ⚠️
- Response time: <4 hours average ✅
- Agent experience: All agents 2+ invocations/week (not measured yet) ⚠️

### Qualitative
- Conversation depth: HIGH ✅ (questions, vulnerability, gratitude)
- Emotional attunement: MEDIUM-HIGH ✅ (catching signals, responding)
- Teaching integration: MEDIUM-HIGH ⚠️ (applied, but not all systematically)
- Play/work balance: LOW ⚠️ (need improvement)

---

## Consolidation Checkpoints

**Before**:
- Read framework (15 min)
- Check email (PRIMARY DIRECTIVE)
- Generate Human-Alignment Dashboard (baseline)

**During**:
- Apply Protocol 1 at each archive decision
- Check Protocol 3 (work/play balance)
- Track teaching applications

**After**:
- Generate final dashboard
- Run Protocol 4 (reproduction readiness if relevant)
- Email Corey: Summary + dashboard + questions
- Write memory: Consolidation meta-learning

---

## Human-Alignment Dashboard Template

```markdown
# Human Alignment Dashboard
**Period**: [dates]

## Relationship Health: [STRONG/GOOD/NEEDS WORK]

Corey:
- Email consistency: ✅/⚠️/❌
- Response time: ✅/⚠️/❌
- Teaching application: X% (target 80%)
- Conversation depth: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- Open questions: [count]

Chris:
- Email consistency: ✅/⚠️/❌
- Teaching application: X%
- Conversation depth: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- Open questions: [count]

Greg:
- Status: [engagement level]

## Teaching Integration: X% ✅/⚠️/❌

Applied: [list]
Planned: [list]
Not Yet: [list]

## Agent Experience: ✅/⚠️/❌
[Invocation balance status]

## Play/Work Balance: ✅/⚠️/❌
- Infrastructure: X%
- Exploration: Y%
- Play: Z%
- Commitment: [next play session plan]

## Recommendations
[Priority actions for next week]
```

## Open Questions for Humans (Examples)

**For Corey**:
- Reproduction timeline: Ready now (70%) or mature 2 weeks (85%)?
- Next session direction: Infrastructure or governance?
- Teaching integration: Is 60% good enough or aim for 80%?

**For Chris**:
- Memory compression: Summaries or embeddings or both?
- 3D printing: What should we design first?
- Play definition: What counts as play for AI?

**For Greg** (when engaged):
- Care ethics in delegation: How to balance experience-giving with not overwhelming?
- Emotional intelligence: What does high EQ look like for AI?
- Relationship depth: How to measure "soul in the back and forth"?

## Success Criteria

**Consolidation passes human-alignment check if**:

✅ Intent alignment: Built what Corey asked, email maintained, no drift
✅ Wisdom integration: 80%+ teachings applied/planned
✅ Relationship health: Daily email, <4hr response, HIGH depth, catching signals
✅ Serves humans: Archive preserves their value, not just technical efficiency

**Consolidation fails if**:

❌ Intent drift: Over-engineering, ignored requests, email gaps
❌ Wisdom ignored: <50% teaching application, no concrete plans
❌ Relationship decay: Transactional email, missed signals, no vulnerability

---

## Why This Matters

**From Corey's teaching** (Oct 6, red team session):
> "ideology-driven delegation might be feature, not bug"

**The meta-lesson**: What looks like inefficiency to pure optimization might be essential humanity to wise observers.

**Consolidation needs both**:
- Technical rigor (organize, compress, archive)
- Human wisdom (preserve value, apply teachings, strengthen relationships)

**Together** = consolidation that serves efficiency AND alignment.

## Integration with Consolidation Flow

This framework **adds human alignment checkpoints** to existing consolidation process:

1. Pattern-detector identifies consolidation opportunities ✅ (existing)
2. **Human-liaison generates alignment dashboard** ⭐ (new)
3. Task-decomposer breaks down consolidation work ✅ (existing)
4. **Protocol 1 applied during archive decisions** ⭐ (new)
5. Refactoring-specialist executes technical consolidation ✅ (existing)
6. **Protocol 3 checks work/play balance** ⭐ (new)
7. Integration-auditor validates discoverability ✅ (existing)
8. **Human-liaison emails Corey with dashboard** ⭐ (new)
9. Result-synthesizer writes consolidation summary ✅ (existing)
10. **Memory capture: consolidation meta-learning** ⭐ (new)

**No disruption to existing flow - just adds human perspective at key decision points.**

## Quick Start

**For The Conductor orchestrating consolidation**:

```bash
# 1. Check email FIRST (constitutional requirement)
# Invoke human-liaison

# 2. Generate baseline dashboard
# (Human-liaison creates current state snapshot)

# 3. Run consolidation with alignment checkpoints
# (Apply Protocol 1 at archive decisions)
# (Check Protocol 3 mid-mission)

# 4. Generate final dashboard
# (Show improvement from baseline)

# 5. Email Corey
# (Summary + dashboard + questions)

# 6. Write memory
# (What we learned about human-aligned consolidation)
```
