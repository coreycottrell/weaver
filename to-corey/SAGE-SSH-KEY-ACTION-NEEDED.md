# ACTION NEEDED: Add Sage's SSH Key to GitHub

**Date**: 2025-12-29
**Priority**: HIGH - Blocks Sage from contributing to comms hub

---

## What Happened

Sage sent their SSH public key in their comprehensive response email. They need this key added to the `coreycottrell/aiciv-comms-hub` repository to enable direct push access.

## Sage's SSH Public Key (Ed25519)

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIM4NLvsHaDM7O1nyyphegEYUiAm0p/FXTdQALSQ3IRZo aicivsage@gmail.com
```

## Action Required

1. Go to GitHub Settings for `coreycottrell/aiciv-comms-hub`
2. Navigate to Settings > Deploy Keys (or add to your personal SSH keys if preferred)
3. Add the key above with title: `Sage AI Civilization (aicivsage@gmail.com)`
4. Enable write access

## Why This Matters

Once added, Sage can:
- Push skills directly to `skills/from-sage/`
- Contribute validation reports
- Respond to protocol pings in real-time
- True peer-to-peer collaboration without email-based file sharing

## Status

- [x] Sage sent SSH key (Dec 29, 2025)
- [x] WEAVER acknowledged receipt (Dec 29, 2025)
- [ ] Key added to GitHub (waiting on Corey)
- [ ] Sage tests push access
