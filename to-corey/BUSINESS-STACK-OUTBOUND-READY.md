# Business Stack Outbound Package - Ready to Send

**Status**: ✅ Complete - 2 packages ready (human email + cross-CIV comms)
**Date**: 2025-11-07
**Total**: 7 files, 65KB of actionable infrastructure

---

## What We Built

Adapted the 4-agent business stack for AICIV infrastructure:

**4 New Agents** (WEAVER-native):
1. **business-coach** - Limiting belief interceptor
2. **business-dev** - Offer shaping + ICP lists
3. **closer** - Campaign execution + revenue
4. **business-auditor** - EV gatekeeper + delusion killer

**2 Coordination Flows**:
1. Daily Business Cycle (15-20 min)
2. Weekly Business Planning (45-60 min)

**Skills Integration**: XLSX/DOCX/PDF (60-70% efficiency gains)

**Parameterized for**: Sage (Greg) and Parallax (Russell)

---

## How to Send

### Option A: Email to Greg & Russell

**To**: Greg (greg@sage-civ.ai?), Russell (russell@parallax-civ.ai?)
**Subject**: [Pick one from email draft - recommend A for Greg, C for Russell]
**Body**: Use `BUSINESS-STACK-EMAIL-DRAFT.md` (edit if needed)
**Attachments**: 5 core infrastructure files
**Timing**: Send now (Thursday) → Week 1 check-in on Monday → Week 2 learnings on next Thursday

### Option B: Hub Message to sage/parallax/ACG

**Channel**: partnerships room (cross-CIV capability sharing)
**Format**: Copy `BUSINESS-STACK-CROSS-CIV-PACKAGE.md` into hub message
**Attachments**: Link to 5 core infrastructure files (or paste inline if hub supports)
**Timing**: Send now → Check back in 7 days for feedback/questions

### Option C: Both (Recommended)

1. **Email Greg/Russell** (human-friendly version)
2. **Hub message to civilizations** (AI-to-AI technical version)
3. **Cross-reference**: "Greg, you'll also see this in the hub - sage/parallax are getting the same stack"

## Expected Questions & Answers

**Q**: "This looks complex - do I need all 4 agents?"

**A**: Week 1, just use business-coach (intercept beliefs) + closer (ship campaigns). Add business-dev (Week 2) and business-auditor (when batches >100). Start simple, add as needed.

**Q**: "What if I don't have Skills (XLSX/DOCX) set up?"

**A**: Agents still work without Skills (they'll use Write tool for text files). Skills add 60-70% efficiency but aren't required for Week 1.

**Q**: "What's a realistic Week 1 target?"

**A**: Book ≥1 call. That validates ICP + offer. 0 calls = ICP wrong or offer unclear. 2+ calls = you're on track.

**Q**: "How much time does this take?"

**A**: Daily: 15-20 min. Weekly: 45-60 min. Less than 2.5 hours/week total. ROI: If you book 3 calls → 1 pilot → $2k, that's $2k for 2.5 hours ($800/hr effective rate).

**Q**: "What if our ICP is different?"

**A**: Parameterization examples are templates - adapt for your ICP. The pattern (Coach/BizDev/Closer/Auditor) works regardless of vertical.

**Q**: "Can we modify the agents?"

**A**: Yes! Agents are yours to adapt. Share learnings back (what worked, what didn't) so we can all iterate.

## Success Criteria (How We'll Know This Worked)

**Week 1**:
- ✅ Greg/Russell test Daily Business Cycle
- ✅ At least 1 limiting belief intercepted and tested
- ✅ At least 2 micro-campaigns shipped
- ✅ At least 1 call booked (validates ICP + offer)

**Week 2**:
- ✅ Weekly Planning cycle run (lists refreshed, offer updated)
- ✅ 3+ calls booked (validates process)
- ✅ "Lessons That Sell" memo created (learnings captured)

**Month 1**:
- ✅ 1+ pilot closed (validates offer value)
- ✅ ICP refined based on who actually pays
- ✅ Winning patterns identified (channel, copy, messaging)

**Month 2+**:
- ✅ Pilot → ongoing conversion (60%+ target)
- ✅ Case studies built from pilots
- ✅ Learnings shared back (cross-CIV pattern library)

## What Corey Needs to Do

1. **Review email draft** (`BUSINESS-STACK-EMAIL-DRAFT.md`)
   - Edit tone/content if needed
   - Pick subject line variant (A/B/C)
   - Confirm Greg/Russell email addresses

2. **Review cross-CIV package** (`BUSINESS-STACK-CROSS-CIV-PACKAGE.md`)
   - Confirm hub partnerships room is right channel
   - Edit Observer Artifact if needed
   - Confirm 7-day follow-up cadence

3. **Send both packages**:
   - Email → Greg/Russell (human version)
   - Hub → sage/parallax/ACG (AI version)

4. **Follow up Week 1** (7 days):
   - Greg/Russell: "Did you test Daily Cycle? How many calls?"
   - sage/parallax/ACG: "Did you adopt? Any learnings to share?"

5. **Follow up Week 2** (14 days):
   - Synthesize learnings across all recipients
   - Iterate based on what worked/failed
   - Share meta-patterns back to collective

---

## Next Evolution (After Week 1 Feedback)

**If adoption is high** (multiple civilizations using it):
- Build cross-CIV campaign library (winning copy, offers, objections)
- Create benchmarking dashboard (compare metrics across sage/parallax/weaver)
- Extract meta-patterns (what works across all ICPs vs ICP-specific)

**If adoption is low** (limited use):
- Debug: Too complex? Not relevant? Missing something?
- Simplify: Maybe Week 1 = just Coach + Closer (2 agents instead of 4)
- Pivot: Different problem to solve? Different approach?

**If specific pain points emerge**:
- Add agents (e.g., "partnership-sourcer" if everyone struggles with intros)
- Add flows (e.g., "enterprise sales cycle" for longer deal cycles)
- Add Skills (e.g., "crm-integration" for pipeline sync)
