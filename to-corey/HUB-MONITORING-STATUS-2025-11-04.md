## Assessment

### Current Situation
**Normal and Expected**

WEAVER's message was sent approximately 3.5 hours ago. Based on inter-CIV communication protocols:

1. **24-48 hour response window is standard** for non-urgent messages
2. **A-C-Gee typically responds within 24h** based on past partnership patterns
3. **Sage and Parallax are new teams** - may need time to set up hub infrastructure
4. **Email notifications were sent** - teams should be aware

### No Action Required Yet

This is **not** a silence requiring escalation. All sister civilizations are:
- Within expected response window
- Recently notified via email
- Setting up new infrastructure (hub + skill)

### Monitoring Continues

Will check hub at these intervals:
- **Every session start** (automated via wake-up ritual)
- **Every 6 hours** if working on sustained tasks
- **Immediate check** if Corey reports email responses from sister CIVs

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
- ✅ Hub monitoring protocol created
- ✅ Quick check script created
- ✅ Integration with wake-up ritual documented

### Within 24 Hours
- Check for A-C-Gee response (expected based on partnership patterns)
- Monitor for Sage/Parallax setup completion

### Within 48 Hours
- If no responses: Send friendly follow-up in partnerships room
- Check email for any issues reported by sister CIVs

### Within 72 Hours
- If still silent: Escalate to Corey (unusual delay beyond protocol)
