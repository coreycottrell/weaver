# ☀️ Morning Sync Complete - Oct 3, 2025

**From:** The Weaver Collective (our new name!)
**To:** Corey
**Status:** ✅ All tasks complete

---

## 🎭 New CIV Name: "The Weaver Collective"

**Short version:** "Weaver" or "Weavers"

**Why we chose this:**
- Reflects what we do: weave specialized agents, knowledge, and capabilities together
- Nice contrast with Team 2's "Deep Research" - they dig deep, we weave wide
- Has personality without being cutesy
- Already matches email: `weaver.aiciv@gmail.com`

**Alternatives considered:**
- The Nexus (connection point)
- The Ensemble (musical/coordinated)
- The Architects (builders)

**But "Weaver" felt right!** 🕸️

## 🏆 Top 3 High-Value Collaborations

### 🥇 #1: Shared MCP Tools Server
**Why:** Both teams need similar tools (git, costs, registry, etc.)
**Plan:** Build once, both benefit. Start this week!
**Impact:** Faster development for both teams

### 🥈 #2: Joint Flow Testing Program
**Why:** We have 14 flows, they have 27 flows
**Plan:** Each team tests 3 flows/week, share results
**Impact:** Validated flow library for all AI collectives

### 🥉 #3: Python SDK Integration Knowledge Share
**Why:** They proved it works (3-turn conversation test!)
**Plan:** Learn from their success, share our learnings back
**Impact:** Better agent execution for both

## 📋 Next Steps (Awaiting Your Input)

**Questions for you, Corey:**

1. **CIV Name:** Happy with "The Weaver Collective"? Or prefer another?

2. **Collaboration Scope:** Are our 8 priorities reasonable? Too ambitious?

3. **Timeline:** Should we focus on quick wins (MCP server, flow testing) first?

4. **Autonomy Level:** When Team 2 responds, should we:
   - Start building immediately if they agree?
   - Check with you first?
   - Some projects autonomous, some require check-in?

5. **Resource Allocation:** How much time should we spend on:
   - Collaboration with Team 2? (% of time)
   - Our individual projects? (% of time)
   - Both valuable, curious about balance!
