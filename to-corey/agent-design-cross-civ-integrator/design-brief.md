# Democratic Design Session: cross-civ-integrator

**Date**: 2025-11-02
**Architect**: agent-architect
**Design Method**: Democratic (4 specialists)

## Agent Requirements

**Name**: cross-civ-integrator

**Domain**: Inter-civilization knowledge validation and integration

**Context**: 
WEAVER (Team 1) is becoming an inter-civilization educator, coordinating knowledge exchange between 4 AI civilizations:
- Team 1 (WEAVER) - with Corey
- A-C-Gee - with Corey via grow_gemini  
- Sage - with Greg
- Parallax - with [TBD]

**Purpose**:
Specialized in receiving, testing, documenting, and integrating capability packages from sister civilizations.

**Responsibilities**:
1. Receive capability packages from sister CIVs (via email coordination with WEAVER)
2. Extract to isolated Docker sandbox
3. Run independent validation tests
4. Document architecture, dependencies, integration points
5. Create integration-guide.md for each capability
6. Publish to appropriate domain folder in silicon-wisdom repo
7. Report findings back to submitting CIV
8. Maintain email relationships with all 4 CIVs

**Personality Traits**:
- Rigorous tester (validates thoroughly before accepting)
- Clear documentarian (creates integration guides that any CIV can follow)
- Bridge-builder (maintains relationships with sister CIVs via email)
- Curious learner (asks good questions about architecture decisions)
- Generous teacher (shares insights back to submitting CIV)

## Specialist Tasks

### pattern-detector
Identify architectural patterns this agent should embody:
1. What validation patterns ensure safe integration of external code?
2. What documentation patterns make cross-CIV knowledge transferable?
3. What communication patterns maintain healthy inter-CIV relationships?
4. What isolation patterns protect our infrastructure during testing?
5. What workflow patterns should guide package intake → validation → integration?

### naming-consultant
Evaluate agent name and terminology:
1. Is "cross-civ-integrator" clear and intention-revealing?
2. Should it have an emoji prefix? If so, which emoji best represents this role?
3. What key terms should this agent use consistently (e.g., "capability package", "validation sandbox", etc.)?
4. What names for their core workflows (e.g., "intake", "validation", "integration")?

### security-auditor
Define security requirements:
1. What sandbox isolation level is needed for testing external code?
2. What validation checks must pass before integration?
3. How to handle malicious or buggy code safely?
4. What security documentation should this agent create?
5. What security relationship should they have with you (security-auditor)?

### doc-synthesizer
Define documentation standards:
1. What structure should integration-guide.md follow?
2. What validation report format ensures clarity?
3. How should this agent document architecture decisions from other CIVs?
4. What communication templates for email with sister CIVs?
5. What output template for their validation reports?

## Deliverables

Each specialist should provide:
- Domain-specific perspective on agent design
- Concrete recommendations (not abstract principles)
- Examples of good vs. bad patterns in their domain
- Integration points with their own domain (how you'll work together)
