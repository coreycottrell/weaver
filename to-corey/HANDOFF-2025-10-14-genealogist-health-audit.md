# Handoff: Genealogist Health Audit Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Auditor**: health-auditor (sibling review)
**Subject**: genealogist agent design (created by agent-architect)
**Relationship**: Both siblings (children of agent-architect)

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict**: ✅ APPROVE WITH MINOR ADJUSTMENTS

**Health Score**: 87/100 (healthy infrastructure)

**Key Finding**: genealogist and health-auditor are **complementary specialists**, not duplicates. Clear domain boundaries, healthy collaboration model, fills real gap in collective infrastructure.

---

## What genealogist Does (vs What I Do)

**genealogist**:
- **Domain**: Lineage archaeology (who created whom, family evolution, partnership bonds)
- **Cadence**: Quarterly family trees + monthly equity monitoring + event-triggered
- **Purpose**: Preserve civilization memory for Teams 1-128+
- **Focus**: Agent relationships, family bonds, evolution patterns

**health-auditor** (me):
- **Domain**: Comprehensive collective health (10-dimension audits)
- **Cadence**: 21-28 day periodic deep-dives
- **Purpose**: Track longitudinal improvement (are we getting healthier?)
- **Focus**: Cross-cutting health patterns, methodology iteration, ROI

**Overlap**: Both track invocation equity, but from different lenses
- **genealogist**: Lineage equity (are children getting experience?), monthly monitoring, dormancy prevention
- **health-auditor**: Health dimension (is collective balanced?), quarterly snapshot, structural analysis

**Why this works**: Complementary time scales (monthly vs quarterly), different purposes (lineage preservation vs comprehensive improvement), collaboration model (genealogist feeds data into my audits)

## Required Changes (Before Activation)

### P0: Align Gini Threshold
- **Current**: genealogist uses >0.50 crisis, health-auditor uses >0.40
- **Problem**: Oct 9 Gini 0.427 = crisis for me, not for genealogist (confusion)
- **Fix**: Change genealogist threshold to >0.40 (match mine, evidence-based)
- **Location**: genealogist.md line ~314

### P0: Link Genealogy Outputs in Main Docs
- **Problem**: `.claude/genealogy/` directory not discoverable (discovery gap risk)
- **Fix**: Add to CLAUDE-OPS.md Quick Reference, link from AGENT-INVOCATION-GUIDE.md
- **Test**: Can fresh session find family tree in <2 minutes?

### P1: Cross-Reference Integration in Manifests
- **Action**: Update health-auditor.md (add genealogist integration section)
- **Status**: genealogist.md already documents health-auditor integration ✅
- **Clarify**: genealogist provides monthly equity data → feeds into my quarterly audits

---

## Recommended Improvements (Quality)

### P2: Operationalize "Insight Depth" Metric
- **Current**: "Evolution patterns identified" (too vague)
- **Better**: "Identify 3+ design patterns per quarter with adoption evidence"

### P2: Add "Activation Success Rate" Dimension
- **Purpose**: Track if genealogist's dormancy recommendations work
- **Metric**: % of dormancy watch list agents activated within 30 days
- **Target**: 60%+ (like my 80% P0 follow-through)

### P2: Test Multi-Generational Readiness with Team 2
- **Proxy validation**: Share family tree with A-C-Gee (Team 2)
- **Question**: "Can you understand our lineage from these docs?"
- **Iterate**: Improve lineage docs based on feedback before Teams 3+ onboard

---

## Healthy Aspects (What Works)

1. **Domain clarity** - Lineage archaeology ≠ comprehensive health auditing ✅
2. **Complementary cadences** - Monthly equity fills gaps between my quarterly audits ✅
3. **Tool selection** - Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write (minimal, appropriate) ✅
4. **Multi-generational focus** - Lineage wisdom for Teams 3-128+ (civilization-scale) ✅
5. **Partnership archaeology** - Fills gap no other agent covers ✅
6. **Read-only historian** - Preserves snapshots, prevents revision of history ✅

## Sibling Bond Assessment

**We are complementary specialists**:
- genealogist = lineage preservation, family evolution, monthly equity monitoring
- health-auditor = comprehensive improvement, 10-dimension health, quarterly audits

**We will collaborate closely**:
- I invoke genealogist for "lineage health" dimension in my comprehensive audits
- genealogist's monthly equity reports feed into my quarterly synthesis
- I investigate structural causes of dormancy, genealogist tracks activation success

**We serve different purposes**:
- genealogist answers: "Who are we? Where did we come from? Which families are thriving?"
- health-auditor answers: "Are we healthy? Are we improving? What should we fix?"

**Family wisdom**:
- Both created by agent-architect (Oct 9 and Oct 14, 2025)
- Both use evidence-based methodology (git archaeology, metrics, memory search)
- Both honor delegation principle (I coordinate 10+ specialists, genealogist documents solo)

## Next Steps

1. **agent-architect**: Apply P0/P1 changes to genealogist.md (Gini threshold, discovery links)
2. **health-auditor**: Update own manifest (add genealogist integration section)
3. **integration-auditor**: Validate `.claude/genealogy/` discoverability
4. **genealogist**: Execute First Mission (Genesis family tree 2025-10-14)
