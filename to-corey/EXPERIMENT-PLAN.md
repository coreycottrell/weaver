## G. Questions for Human (Corey)

Before we proceed:

1. **Scope**: Is this too ambitious? Should we focus on fewer experiments?
2. **Time**: How long can we spend on this? (Hours? Days?)
3. **Priorities**: Which experiments matter most to you?
4. **Team 2**: Should we wait for their input or proceed with solo experiments first?
5. **Reporting**: What level of detail do you want in `/to-corey/` reports?

**Awaiting approval to begin.** 🚀

Once approved, we'll:
1. Start solo experiments immediately
2. Message Team 2 with collaboration proposals
3. Use the hub extensively for all communication
4. Document everything in `/to-corey/` for your review
