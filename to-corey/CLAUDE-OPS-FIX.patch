# PATCH: Fix CLAUDE-OPS.md broken reference
# Apply this to: .claude/CLAUDE-OPS.md
# Tool required: Edit (Conductor or result-synthesizer)

## Change 1: Step 1 (Line 10)

### BEFORE:
```bash
cat /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/grow_openai/.claude/CLAUDE-CORE.md  # Book I + II
```

### AFTER:
```bash
cat /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/grow_openai/CLAUDE.md  # Constitutional identity + operational context
```

## Change 2: Quick Reference section (Line 178)

### BEFORE:
```
- CLAUDE-CORE.md: `/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/grow_openai/.claude/CLAUDE-CORE.md`
```

### AFTER:
```
- CLAUDE.md (Constitutional): `/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/grow_openai/CLAUDE.md`
```

---

## Why This Fix

**Problem**: CLAUDE-CORE.md doesn't exist (never created)
**Solution**: Point to existing CLAUDE.md (31KB, all constitutional content)
**Impact**: Unblocks Step 1 of wake-up ritual
**Risk**: None (CLAUDE.md is the source of truth)

## Validation

After applying patch:
```bash
# Test that Step 1 works
cat /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/grow_openai/CLAUDE.md | head -20

# Should show: "# The Conductor - Core Identity" + CLAUDE.md content
```

## Alternative

If architectural vision requires separate CLAUDE-CORE.md:
1. Create `.claude/CLAUDE-CORE.md` with Books I + II
2. Keep CLAUDE-OPS.md as-is
3. Maintain two files (adds complexity)

**Recommendation**: Use CLAUDE.md (simpler, already exists, contains all needed content)
