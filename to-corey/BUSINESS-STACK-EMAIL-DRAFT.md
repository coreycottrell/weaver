## Email Body

Hey Greg / Russell,

We just built something I think you'll find useful - a 4-agent business operations stack that's designed to snap limiting beliefs in half and turn vague motion into actual pipeline.

**The Problem It Solves**:

You've probably said (or heard) things like:
- "We can't reach out until we have a full case study"
- "We need to build X before anyone will talk to us"
- "The only way to get meetings is..."

These are limiting beliefs masquerading as strategy. They kill momentum.

**What We Built**:

4 specialized agents that run as a daily/weekly cycle:

1. **business-coach** - Catches limiting statements, generates 3 testable alternatives (≤30 min each), forces you to pick one NOW
2. **business-dev** - Weekly refresh: 10-account list + 10-partner list + offer brief + 3 experiments
3. **closer** - Daily execution: Ships 2-3 micro-campaigns, books calls, logs "Lessons That Sell"
4. **business-auditor** - Gatekeeps: If EV<0 or spam risk, blocks and proposes safer test

**The Key Insight**:

Intensity (daily outreach) WITHOUT guardrails = noise and brand damage.
Strategy (careful planning) WITHOUT tests = paralysis.

This stack is both: "Pressure washer with a stencil" - force applied, shape preserved.

**How It Works**:

**Daily (15-20 min)**:
- Coach scans for "we can't..." → generates tests
- Closer ships campaigns → books calls → logs metrics
- Auditor spot-checks tomorrow's queue

**Weekly (45-60 min)**:
- BizDev refreshes lists, updates offer, queues experiments
- Auditor validates (proof exists? EV > 0?)
- Closer reviews pipeline, identifies winners
- Auditor reality-checks (where did we lie to ourselves?)

**Golden Metric**: Meetings booked per week (target ≥3)

Everything else (sends, opens, replies) is a leading indicator, not a victory lap.

**For You Specifically**:

**Greg (Sage)**:
- ICP: AI researchers, consciousness/alignment orgs
- Coach intercepts academic perfectionism ("need paper before...")
- Auditor protects credibility (no hype, citations required)
- Channels: Warm academic intros, Twitter DMs, conference follow-ups

**Russell (Parallax)**:
- ICP: Enterprise 100-5000 employees, AI/ML initiatives
- Coach intercepts enterprise caution ("need security audit before...")
- Auditor manages legal/compliance risk (NDA, SOC2, data handling)
- Channels: LinkedIn, C-level warm intros, partner referrals

**What's Included**:

Attached package contains:
- 4 agent manifests (business-coach, business-dev, closer, business-auditor)
- Integration guide (flows, invocation patterns, Skills usage)
- Example invocations (copy-paste ready)
- Success metrics and red flags
- Parameterization examples for your ICPs

**Skills Integration**:

All agents use WEAVER's Skills system:
- **XLSX**: Campaign logs, belief trackers, EV calculators, pipeline dashboards
- **DOCX**: Offer briefs, copy variants, "Lessons That Sell" memos
- **PDF**: Competitor analysis, market research, compliance docs

60-70% efficiency gains vs scratch notes (validated in WEAVER Phase 1).

**How to Start**:

**Week 1**:
1. Pick ONE ICP and ONE offer (don't overthink - you'll iterate)
2. Run Daily Business Cycle (15-20 min/day)
3. Ship 2 micro-campaigns/day via Closer
4. Target: Book ≥3 calls by end of week

**Week 2**:
1. Review what worked/failed (Closer's "Lessons That Sell")
2. Tighten ICP based on who actually booked calls
3. Update offer brief based on objections/questions
4. Run Weekly Planning cycle (45-60 min)

**Red Team (How This Fails)**:

1. **Vanity metrics**: "We sent 500 emails!" ≠ win. "We booked 5 calls" = win.
2. **Skipping Auditor**: Shortcuts torch your brand. Always get PASS before batches >100.
3. **Ignoring Coach**: Beliefs you don't test become assumptions you defend. Test everything.
4. **Wrong ICP**: Great message, wrong people = 0% reply rate. Tighten after 3 conversations.

**The Math**:

If you book 3 calls/week:
- 12 calls/month
- 30% close rate = 3-4 pilots/month
- $2k pilots = $6-8k MRR in Month 1
- 60% pilot→ongoing conversion = $15-20k MRR by Month 3

**Files Attached**:

1. `BUSINESS-AGENTS-AICIV-INTEGRATION.md` - Full integration guide
2. `.claude/agents/business-coach.md` - Agent manifest
3. `.claude/agents/business-dev.md` - Agent manifest
4. `.claude/agents/closer.md` - Agent manifest
5. `.claude/agents/business-auditor.md` - Agent manifest

**Next Step**:

Try it for 1 week. If you book ≥1 call, you'll know it works. If you book 0, we'll debug (probably ICP or offer, rarely the process).

Let me know how it goes - happy to iterate based on your learnings.

## Alternate Subject Lines (A/B Test)

- **A**: "4 agents that convert beliefs → pipeline → revenue"
- **B**: "Stop saying 'we can't' - here's the stack that ships"
- **C**: "Business operations stack - book 3 calls this week"

**Recommendation**: Use A for Greg (research-oriented), C for Russell (metric-oriented)

## Follow-Up Cadence

**Day 3**: "Did you run the Daily Cycle? Any limiting beliefs caught?"
**Day 7**: "Weekly check-in - how many calls booked? What won/lost?"
**Day 14**: "Sharing learnings across Sage/Parallax - what patterns emerged?"
