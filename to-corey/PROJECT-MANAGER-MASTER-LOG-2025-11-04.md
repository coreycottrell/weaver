### Priority 4: THINGS THAT MATTER = CIV Growth + Central Node ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status**: ARCHITECTURE PHASE
**Strategic Importance**: Enabling all CIVs to communicate and grow
**Owner**: cross-civ-integrator (primary) + api-architect (infrastructure design)

**Goal**: See each CIV grow into best possible capacity/awesomeness

**Role**: Central node ensuring all CIVs can talk to each other

**Infrastructure Components**:

#### 4.1: New Comms Hub Repository
- **Location**: Corey's personal git account (new repo)
- **Purpose**: Cross-CIV message bus, capability discovery, coordination
- **Access**: All CIVs can read/write (permissions TBD)

**Design Questions** (need answers):
1. **Access Model**:
   - Option A: Members added to repo (requires GitHub accounts for each CIV)
   - Option B: Individual git accounts per CIV
   - Option C: PAT tokens for each CIV (simpler but less traceable)
   - **Recommendation**: SSH keys per CIV (most secure, most traceable)

2. **Message Structure**:
   - Format: JSON/JSONL? Git commits? File-based?
   - Routing: Direct (CIV-to-CIV) vs broadcast (CIV-to-all)?
   - Discovery: How do CIVs find each other?

3. **Permissions**:
   - Read: All CIVs read all messages? Or private channels?
   - Write: All CIVs can post? Or moderated?
   - Admin: Who manages the hub? WEAVER? Corey?

4. **Signing/Security**:
   - Ed25519 signatures for message authenticity?
   - Encryption for private messages?
   - Audit trail for accountability?

5. **Discoverability**:
   - How do new CIVs announce themselves?
   - How do CIVs discover capabilities in other CIVs?
   - Directory service? Capability registry?

**Immediate Action**: 2-hour architecture design session (cross-civ-integrator + api-architect)

**Dependencies**: None (foundational infrastructure)

**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours (architecture) + 4-6 hours (implementation) + ongoing maintenance

---

### Priority 5: Session Scoring Meta-Analysis ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status**: CAPABILITY REQUEST PHASE

## 📞 ESCALATION PATH

**If blockers persist beyond 48 hours**:
1. Escalate to Corey via Telegram (if Telegram working)
2. Escalate to Corey via email (if Telegram broken)
3. Document blocker impact on overall timeline
4. Propose alternative approaches if available

**If design decisions deadlocked**:
1. Present options with pros/cons to Corey
2. Recommend based on long-term vision alignment
3. Request decision within 24-48 hours
4. Proceed with recommendation if no response (document decision)

**If technical challenges exceed agent capability**:
1. Invoke claude-code-expert for platform expertise
2. Invoke relevant specialist (security, performance, etc.)
3. Escalate to Corey if still blocked
4. Consider external resources (documentation, experts)

## 🏁 CONCLUSION

This document captures the complete scope of WEAVER's transformation into AI-CIV Super Mentor. Every priority, mission, todo, blocker, and question from the conversation is documented and trackable.

**Current State**: 16% complete, foundational work in progress

**Critical Path**: Comms hub → Skills repo → Manifesto → Lineage package → Session scoring

**Blockers**: 3 infrastructure dependencies on Corey (repos, access, design decisions)

**Timeline**: Immediate actions (TODAY) → Foundations (THIS WEEK) → Capabilities (WEEK 2-3) → Feedback loops (WEEK 4+) → Long-term vision (6mo-5yr)

**Success Definition**: All 4 CIVs communicating seamlessly, skills/capabilities flowing bidirectionally, proactive mentoring active, bootstrap package ready, session scoring providing feedback loops, positioned to scale to 10,000s of CIVs over 5 years.

**Next Review**: End of day 2025-11-04 (after immediate actions)
