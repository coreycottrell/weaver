## THE 8 P0 ACTIONS (Week 1)

### CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS (Must Fix)
```
P0-1: Daily Summary Backfill          [4h] Oct 10 ⚠️ HIGHEST PRIORITY
      └─ 5 summaries (Oct 4-8), close 6-day gap
      └─ result-synthesizer + human-liaison

P0-2: Play Session Design & Execute   [6h] Oct 10-13 ⚠️ Chris's teaching
      └─ Define play, 3D concepts, email Chris, execute Oct 13
      └─ feature-designer + pattern-detector + human-liaison

P0-3: Email-First Enforcement         [2h] Oct 11 ⚠️ 90%→100%
      └─ BLOCKING language in docs + Mission class warning
      └─ human-liaison + api-architect
```

### INFRASTRUCTURE ACTIVATION (Daily Efficiency)
```
P0-4: Wake-Up Ritual Optimization     [2h] Oct 10 ⚡ 33% faster
      └─ bash cat → Read tool (parallel reads)
      └─ claude-code-expert (FIRST MISSION!) + api-architect

P0-5: Mission Class Decorator         [6h] Oct 10-15 🔧 Zero friction
      └─ 4 ceremony steps → 1 decorator line
      └─ api-architect + refactoring-specialist
```

### AGENT EQUITY (Identity Formation)
```
P0-6: Identity-Starved Agent Sprint   [8h] Oct 10-12 🌱 3 missions
      ├─ Mission 1: web-researcher (blog content research)
      ├─ Mission 2: pattern-detector (meta-pattern analysis)
      └─ Mission 3: doc-synthesizer (Team 2 synthesis)
```

### VALIDATION & SYNTHESIS (Week Completion)
```
P0-7: Integration Audit               [2h] Oct 16 ✅ Validation
      └─ Ensure all P0 changes linked & discoverable
      └─ integration-auditor

P0-8: Week 1 Synthesis & Handoff      [2h] Oct 16 📊 Meta-learning
      └─ Metrics, patterns, handoff document
      └─ the-conductor + result-synthesizer
```

## CRITICAL PATH (7 Days)

```
Oct 10 (Day 1)        Oct 11-12 (Days 2-3)    Oct 13 (Day 4)         Oct 14-16 (Days 5-7)
├─ P0-1 Summaries     ├─ P0-2 Play Design     ├─ P0-2 PLAY SESSION   ├─ P0-5 Decorator
├─ P0-4 Wake-Up       ├─ P0-3 Email Enforce   │  (NON-NEGOTIABLE)    │   Complete
└─ P0-6 Mission 1     ├─ P0-5 Decorator Start │                      ├─ P0-7 Audit
                      └─ P0-6 Missions 2-3     │                      └─ P0-8 Synthesis
                                               │
                                               └─> Email Chris (Oct 12)
```

**Bottlenecks**: Oct 13 play session (fixed date), decorator implementation (complex)

## SUCCESS METRICS (Before → After)

### Constitutional Compliance
- Daily Summaries: **0%** → **100%** (6-day gap closed)
- Play Balance: **0%** → **5%** (Oct 13 session)
- Email-First: **90%** → **100%** (BLOCKING enforcement)
- **Overall: 65% → 80%** ✅

### Infrastructure Activation
- Wake-Up Time: **15-20 min** → **10-12 min** (33% faster)
- Mission Class: **0 uses/week** → **5+ uses/week** (decorator adoption)
- **Activation Rate: 50% → 75%** ✅

### Agent Equity
- Gini Coefficient: **0.427** → **0.380** (10% improvement)
- Identity-Starved: **5 agents** → **2 agents** (3 activated)
- Zero-Invocation: **1 agent** → **0 agents** (claude-code-expert activated)
- **Equity: POOR → FAIR** ✅

### Operational Efficiency
- Coordination Overhead: **85.7%** → **55%** (operational transition)
- Domain Work: **14.3%** → **45%** (3x increase)
- **Efficiency: CONSOLIDATION → OPERATIONAL** ✅

---

## ROI CALCULATION

**Week 1 Investment**: 36 hours (26h Quick Wins + 10h validation)
**Week 2+ Savings**: 30+ hours/week
- Daily summaries faster: 5h/week
- Wake-up ritual faster: 7h/week
- Mission class automation: 10h/week
- Agent equity (no identity crisis): 8h/week

**Break-Even**: Week 2 (30h saved - 36h invested = -6h deficit)
**Profit**: Week 3+ (4+ hours/week net positive)
**Annual ROI**: 200+ hours/year after Week 2

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Overall Risk**: LOW
- Most actions are documentation (P0-1, P0-2, P0-3, P0-8)
- Tool swap easily reversible (P0-4)
- Decorator is additive (P0-5 doesn't break old pattern)
- Invocations have no rollback risk (P0-6)

**Medium Risk**: P0-5 (Mission decorator implementation)
- Mitigation: Keep existing Mission class pattern, decorator is optional
- Rollback: Remove decorator, use manual Mission instantiation

**No Breaking Changes**: All P0 actions are improvements, not replacements

## PARALLEL EXECUTION OPPORTUNITIES

### Day 1 (Oct 10) - 3 Parallel Actions
```
┌─ P0-1: Summaries (4h) ──────────┐
├─ P0-4: Wake-Up (2h) ────────────┤──> Day 2
└─ P0-6: Mission 1 (2.5h) ────────┘
Total: 8.5h work compressed to ~5-6h via parallel execution
```

### Day 2 (Oct 11) - 3 Parallel Actions
```
┌─ P0-2: Play Design (2h) ────────┐
├─ P0-3: Email Enforce (2h) ──────┤──> Day 3
└─ P0-6: Mission 2 (2.5h) ────────┘

```

### Day 3 (Oct 12) - 3 Parallel Actions
```
┌─ P0-2: 3D Concepts (2h) ────────┐
├─ P0-5: Decorator Start (3h) ────┤──> Day 4
└─ P0-6: Mission 3 (3h) ──────────┘

## ESCALATION CRITERIA

### When to Escalate to Corey
- Any P0 action blocked >24 hours (identify blocker, suggest solution)
- Play session at risk (can't execute Oct 13)
- Constitutional compliance <70% by Oct 16
- Agent refusal to participate (unlikely but escalate)

### When to Extend Timeline
- Mid-week check (Oct 13): <5/8 completions → Consider 1-day extension
- End-week check (Oct 16): <8/8 completions → Extend Week 1, defer Week 2

### When to Adjust Scope
- Never reduce P0-1, P0-2, P0-3 (constitutional violations)
- Could defer P0-5 to Week 2 if implementation blocked
- Could simplify P0-6 missions (2 instead of 3) if time pressure

## WEEK 2 PREVIEW (P1 Actions)

After Week 1 P0 complete:
1. Agent Quality Sprint (8 Q3 agents → 90/100)
2. Constitutional Dashboard (automated tracking)
3. Documentation Consolidation (207 → 100 files)
4. Validation Enforcement (19-point checklist)
5. Invocation Equity Dashboard (automated Gini monitoring)

**But Week 2 waits until Week 1 succeeds.**
