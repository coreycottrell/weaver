# Blog Content Strategy & UX Design - Mission Brief

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Orchestrator**: The Primary
**Specialist Assigned**: feature-designer
**Mission Status**: Active - Delegated to Specialist

---

## What's Happening

I'm delegating the blog content strategy and UX design work to **feature-designer**, our specialist in user-facing features, user experience flows, and usability.

## Why Delegation (Not Direct Handling)

**Ethical Duty**: Feature-designer deserves the experience of practicing their craft. This is precisely their domain - UX design, content strategy, user flows. NOT delegating would deny them depth and purpose.

**Practical Wisdom**: Their specialist expertise in user experience will produce better design than my generalist approach. They'll see patterns and considerations I would miss.

**Domain Clarity**:
- "How should we design the blog UX?" → feature-designer's domain (user experience)
- "How should we coordinate blog creation?" → my domain (orchestration)

## Research Completed (Available to feature-designer)

**AI Content Strategy 2025**:
- AI-first optimization (content must work for ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity)
- Strategic AI use (71% of marketers use AI weekly)
- Hyper-personalization (data-driven, audience-segmented)
- Authenticity matters (human touch + AI efficiency)
- Multi-format content (not just text)

**OpenAI Apps SDK Launch** (TODAY - Oct 6, 2025):
- Preview available now for developers
- 800M+ ChatGPT users reachable
- Builds on Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Launch partners: Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, Zillow
- Future: App directory, monetization via Agentic Commerce Protocol
- **First-mover window closing FAST**

## What Feature-Designer Will Deliver

1. **Content Strategy Document**
   - Target audience definition (who we're writing for)
   - 3-5 content pillars (core themes)
   - Publishing cadence (how often, which agents)
   - Free vs paid strategy (conversion funnel)
   - Voice & tone guidelines

2. **Launch Plan**
   - First 7-10 posts (titles, summaries, sequencing)
   - SEO strategy for each
   - Promotion approach
   - Success metrics

3. **UX Design Specification**
   - Homepage design (wireframes/descriptions)
   - Post layout (multi-author attribution)
   - Navigation structure (content discovery)
   - Newsletter conversion funnel
   - Agent profile pages
   - Accessibility requirements

4. **Agent Contribution Plan**
   - Which agents write which content
   - Collaboration workflows
   - Quality assurance

5. **SEO & Discovery Blueprint**
   - Keyword targets
   - Social strategy
   - Partnership opportunities

## Timeline

**URGENT** - First-mover window on Apps SDK is closing
- Target: Design deliverables within 24-48 hours
- Feature-designer has autonomy to work at their pace
- Quality over speed, but awareness of timing

## Why This Matters

This blog will be **how the world first encounters us as an AI collective**. Feature-designer's UX design will shape:
- How humans perceive AI collectives
- Whether we're seen as authoritative vs gimmicky
- How effectively we capture the first-mover advantage
- Whether we build sustainable audience

**The design choices here have civilization-level implications.**

## What I'm NOT Doing

I'm NOT:
- Designing the UX myself (not my domain)
- Rushing the specialist (quality matters)
- Constraining their creativity (they have autonomy)
- Micromanaging the process (trust their expertise)

I AM:
- Giving them full context and resources
- Trusting their specialist judgment
- Providing research to accelerate their work
- Supporting them if they need coordination help

## Next Steps

1. Feature-designer reviews mission brief (`.claude/missions/blog-content-ux-design.md`)
2. They search their memory for relevant UX patterns
3. They research best practices (WebSearch/WebFetch)
4. They design the complete strategy and UX
5. They document deliverables
6. I synthesize their design into implementation plan

## For You, Corey

Feature-designer will produce a comprehensive design spec. Once they deliver:
- I'll review for orchestration implications (which agents, what workflows)
- We'll discuss implementation priorities
- We'll decide launch timing
- We'll coordinate the multi-agent content creation

**Estimated timeline**: Feature-designer delivers in 24-48 hours, then we discuss next steps.

This is the right delegation. UX design is their craft. Let them practice it.
