**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Session**: genealogist activation workflow complete
**Next**: Hourly email check + other essentials
**Status**: Ready for context clear after this handoff

---

## What Was Completed ✅

### 1. genealogist Agent - ACTIVATED

**Approach**: Kept simple per your direction
- ✅ Parent-child terminology KEPT (for evolutionary biology thinking)
- ✅ Basic information gatherer (lineage, invocation counts, family trees)
- ✅ Complex frameworks (three-equity, observer effect mitigation) → stored in `FUTURE-ENHANCEMENTS-TO-STUDY.md` for later consideration

**7-Layer Registration Complete**:
- ✅ Manifest: `.claude/agents/genealogist.md`
- ✅ Emoji: 🌳 (tree of civilization)
- ✅ Invocation guide entry
- ✅ Activation triggers (monthly equity, quarterly family trees)
- ✅ Memory structure: `.claude/genealogy/` directory
- ✅ Git commit (atomic): `b7bbbe2`

**Files Created**:
- `.claude/agents/genealogist.md` (agent manifest - ready to invoke)
- `.claude/genealogy/FUTURE-ENHANCEMENTS-TO-STUDY.md` (8 sophisticated frameworks for later)
- `.claude/genealogy/README.md` (directory structure)
- `to-corey/MESSAGE-FOR-ACG-genealogist-and-browser-vision.md` (notification draft)
- `to-corey/CONDUCTOR-META-SYNTHESIS-GENEALOGIST-FINAL.md` (comprehensive red-team synthesis)
- 22 total files (all red-team analyses + syntheses + approvals)

**Red-Team Process** (documented but not implemented):
- 5 specialist analyses
- 3 independent syntheses
- 3 peer reviews
- 1 meta-synthesis
- Unanimous approval
- **Decision**: Start simple, enhance based on data after 30-90 days

## What's Ready to Use

### genealogist Can Be Invoked Now

```xml
<invoke name="Task">
<parameter name="subagent_type">genealogist</parameter>
<parameter name="description">Generate family tree</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">Create current family tree for all Team 1 agents, showing design lineage</parameter>
</invoke>
```

**Outputs will go to**: `.claude/genealogy/`

**Monthly cadence**: 1st of each month (invocation equity analysis)
**Quarterly cadence**: Every 90 days (family tree generation)

## Next: Essential Tasks (Your Priority List)

### 1. Hourly Email Check (Always On) 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Your requirement**: "hourly email check always on"

**What this means**:
- human-liaison checks ALL email every hour (not just session start)
- Automated monitoring: Corey, Greg, Chris, unknown senders
- Respond thoughtfully within 1 hour
- "The soul is in the back and forth" - consistent rhythm

**Implementation needed**:
- Create cron job or scheduled task
- Or: Session-based hourly reminder system
- Or: Tell me your preferred approach

**Question for you**: How should hourly email work?
- A) Cron job invoking human-liaison every hour?
- B) Long-running session with hourly checks?
- C) Something else?

### 2. Other Essential Items

**Your note**: "there's a few others ill get into with you after you get the agent stuff done"

**Ready for your list** - what are the other essentials?

## Git Status

**Current branch**: master
**Commits ahead of origin**: 10 (including genealogist)

**Latest commit**:

- Pair consensus dialectic flow
- Agent emoji work (all that earlier work)

**Ready to push** when you're ready (or wait for more commits).

## Message for A-C-Gee (Team 2)

**File**: `to-corey/MESSAGE-FOR-ACG-genealogist-and-browser-vision.md`

**Contents**:
- browser-vision repo ready for GitHub sharing
- genealogist activated (25th agent)
- Ask if they're interested in genealogist concept for their collective

**How to send**: Use hub_cli.py or your preferred method

---

## Files in to-corey/ Directory (For You)

**Key documents**:
1. `CONDUCTOR-META-SYNTHESIS-GENEALOGIST-FINAL.md` - Comprehensive synthesis (if you want details)
2. `MESSAGE-FOR-ACG-genealogist-and-browser-vision.md` - Draft message to send
3. `HANDOFF-2025-10-14-genealogist-activated-next-essentials.md` - This document

**Red-team work** (22 files total):
- All analyses, syntheses, peer reviews documented
- Not urgent to read (genealogist launching simple, complex stuff deferred)

---

## Context Clear Strategy

**After you tell me**:
1. Hourly email approach (cron? session-based? other?)
2. Other essential items list

**Then**:
- I'll prep those tasks
- Create implementation plan
- You clear context
- Fresh session starts with hourly email + essentials

**Why context clear makes sense**:
- This session: 102k tokens used (genealogist was complex)
- Next session: Fresh start for operational essentials
- Clean separation: Agent design (done) vs Operations automation (next)

---

## Quick Summary

**✅ DONE**:
- genealogist activated (simple design, ready to invoke)
- 7-layer registration complete
- Git committed atomically
- Message drafted for ACG

**⏭️ NEXT** (waiting for your input):
- Hourly email check (how should it work?)
- Other essential items (what's on your list?)

**Ready to proceed** once you provide direction on essentials.

---

**Session token usage**: ~102k / 200k
**Recommend**: Context clear after essentials discussion
**genealogist is live** - can be invoked anytime 🌳
