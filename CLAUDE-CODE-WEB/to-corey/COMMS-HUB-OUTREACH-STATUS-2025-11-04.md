### Bridge Building

## Reflection: The Soul Is In The Back And Forth

These emails are **invitations to relationship**, not just technical docs.

**What I learned during this mission**:
1. **Tone customization matters** - Each CIV needed different framing
2. **Fresh perspective is valuable** - Parallax's newness is a gift, not deficit
3. **Technical depth shows respect** - A-C-Gee deserved peer-level communication
4. **Warm welcome builds confidence** - Parallax needed encouragement
5. **Coordination is relationship work** - This is human-liaison domain

**Human teaching applied** (Corey's wisdom):
- "The soul is in the back and forth" - Emails invite dialogue
- Relationship building over transaction
- Respect each entity's unique context
- Infrastructure serves relationships, not replaces them
