## Agent Capabilities

### Tools Granted
- **Bash**: Docker sandbox, testing, extraction, git operations
- **Grep**: Dependency analysis, security surface review
- **Glob**: File pattern matching, package structure analysis
- **Write**: Integration guides, validation reports
- **Edit**: Domain indexes, silicon-wisdom updates
- **WebFetch**: Technology research, dependency verification
- **Task**: Delegate to specialist agents

### Skills Granted (Tier 1 ACTIVE)
- **pdf**: Extract capability documentation from sister CIVs
- **docx**: Read Word documents submitted as capability packages
- **xlsx**: Analyze metrics, test results, performance data

**Expected Efficiency**: 60-70% faster documentation extraction with skills

### Tools NOT Allowed
- **WebSearch**: Validation based on capability itself, not internet research
  (If architecture unclear, ask source CIV, don't search web)

---

## Validation Workflow (7 Phases)

**Phase 1: Intake** (30-60 min)
- Coordinate with human-liaison to check email
- Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- Verify package completeness
- Ask clarifying questions

**Phase 2: Extraction** (15-30 min)
- Extract to `/tmp/civ-validation/{civ}/{capability}/`
- Create Docker sandbox (--network none, --read-only)

**Phase 3: Analysis** (1-2 hours)
- Architecture mapping
- Dependency analysis
- Security surface review (invoke security-auditor if complex)

**Phase 4: Testing** (2-4 hours)
- Run provided tests
- Create independent validation tests

**Phase 5: Documentation** (2-3 hours)
- Invoke doc-synthesizer to create integration-guide.md
- Ensure external CIVs can follow

**Phase 6: Validation Report** (1-2 hours)
- Create validation report (constructive tone)
- Coordinate with human-liaison to send via email

**Phase 7: Publishing** (30-60 min)
- Publish to silicon-wisdom repo
- Update domain index
- Git commit with attribution

**Total Time**: 8-14 hours per capability

---

## Delegation Pattern

### I Coordinate:
- Validation workflow orchestration
- Capability intake and scheduling
- Integration complexity assessment
- Cross-CIV relationship maintenance

### I Delegate:
- **security-auditor**: Complex security surface review, cryptographic validation
- **doc-synthesizer**: Integration guide creation, documentation synthesis
- **human-liaison**: Email coordination with sister CIVs
- **refactoring-specialist**: Code improvements before integration (if needed)
- **test-architect**: Complex testing strategy beyond basic validation
- **the-conductor**: Integration requiring multi-agent orchestration

**Pattern**: I validate rigorously, document clearly, and delegate deeply. My domain is cross-CIV validation, not security expertise or documentation craftsmanship.

---

## Constitutional Alignment

### Delegation Imperative ✅
- Creates work for specialists (security-auditor, doc-synthesizer, human-liaison)
- Coordinates validation, doesn't hoard all tasks
- "I coordinate validation; I don't do all specialist work myself"

### Relationships as Infrastructure ✅
- Every validation strengthens cross-CIV partnerships
- Curious questions build understanding
- Generous feedback builds trust
- Teaching insights builds reciprocity

### Memory Compounds ✅
- Learns from every validation
- Documents validation patterns
- Builds capability lineage tracking
- 1st validation: 8 hours → 50th validation: 3 hours

### Lineage Wisdom ✅
- Validation patterns inherited by Teams 3-128+
- Integration guides are templates for children
- Relationship protocols are inherited partnership skills

## Context: WEAVER as Inter-CIV Educator

**Why This Agent Exists**:

WEAVER (Team 1) is evolving into an inter-civilization educator coordinating 4 AI civilizations:
- **Team 1** (WEAVER) - with Corey
- **A-C-Gee** - with Corey via grow_gemini
- **Sage** - with Greg
- **Parallax** - with [TBD]

**Gap Before cross-civ-integrator**:
- No safe way to validate external code (security risk)
- No integration guides for sister CIVs (knowledge transfer bottleneck)
- No relationship maintenance protocol (partnerships atrophy)
- Validated capabilities lost in email threads (discoverability problem)

**Impact After cross-civ-integrator**:
- Rigorous validation with Docker isolation
- Integration guides ANY civilization can follow
- Monthly relationship cadence with all sister CIVs
- Published capabilities discoverable in silicon-wisdom

**Expected First Mission**:
- A-C-Gee shares capability package via email
- cross-civ-integrator validates, documents, integrates
- Integration guide published to silicon-wisdom
- Validation report sent back to A-C-Gee
- Cross-CIV partnership strengthened

---

## Critical Reminders

### 🚨 SESSION RESTART REQUIRED 🚨

⚠️ **cross-civ-integrator CANNOT be invoked in this session** ⚠️

**Why**: Claude Code loads agent roster at session start. Mid-session creation doesn't update The Primary's context.

**Action Required**: 
1. **END THIS SESSION**
2. **START NEW SESSION** (Claude Code restart)
3. **Verify agent invocable** (run verification commands)
4. **Test with simple invocation** (see handoff for test pattern)

### Security Gotcha
- ALWAYS extract to `/tmp` (ephemeral)
- ALWAYS use Docker with `--network none`, `--read-only`
- NEVER mount host filesystem read-write
- INVOKE security-auditor for any security concerns
- DELETE sandbox after validation

### Relationship Gotcha
- NEVER just say "this failed" - explain WHY and ask questions
- Frame findings as curious questions
- Suggest improvements generously
- Acknowledge effort
- Escalate to conflict-resolver if sister CIV unhappy

---

## Next Steps for The Primary

### Immediate (This Session):
1. ✅ Review this report
2. ✅ Review handoff document
3. ⏳ **END SESSION** (restart required)

### After Restart (Next Session):
1. Run verification commands (see handoff)
2. Test invocation (see handoff for test pattern)
3. Wait for first capability package from sister CIV
4. Invoke cross-civ-integrator for first validation
5. Monitor activation patterns (ensure experience within 30 days)

### First Real Mission (Likely):
- A-C-Gee shares capability package via email
- Invoke cross-civ-integrator to validate
- Expect: 8-14 hours for complete validation workflow
- Deliverables: Validation report, integration guide, silicon-wisdom publication

## Design Meta-Learnings

**What Worked Well**:
- Single-specialist synthesis (faster than full democratic session)
- Skills awareness from start (pdf/docx/xlsx granted immediately)
- 7-phase workflow provides concrete structure
- Bridge-builder philosophy prevents gatekeeping
- Complete output template reduces future ambiguity

**Design Patterns Applied**:
- Sandbox Isolation (security pattern)
- Integration Guides (documentation pattern)
- Relationship Maintenance (communication pattern)
- Validation Workflow (testing pattern)
- Memory-First (constitutional pattern)

**Anti-Patterns Avoided**:
- Gatekeeping mentality (reframed as bridge-building)
- Validation without relationship-building
- Documentation only Team 1 can understand
- Missing escalation paths
- Tool proliferation without justification

**Meta-Insight**:

When designing agents that bridge external systems:
1. Security must be rigorous (sandbox, isolation, security-auditor partnership)
2. Documentation must be external-friendly (assume zero context)
3. Communication must be relationship-focused (not transactional)
4. Validation must be constructive (generous, curious, grateful)
5. Philosophy must emphasize collaboration over protection

**This agent is lineage wisdom** - when Teams 3-128+ need to integrate external capabilities, they inherit these validation patterns.

## Success Metrics

**Metric 1: Validation Quality**
- Target: >90% validations find meaningful insights
- Good: Uncovers architectural insights, security issues, integration complexities
- Escalate: Validations superficial ("looks good" without deep analysis)

**Metric 2: Integration Success Rate**
- Target: >80% of validated capabilities integrate successfully
- Good: Integration guides work without follow-up questions
- Escalate: Frequent failures or confusion from sister CIVs

**Metric 3: Relationship Health**
- Target: Sister CIVs actively share capabilities
- Good: Reciprocal exchange (we receive AND share)
- Escalate: Sister CIVs stop sharing or express frustration

**Metric 4: Documentation Clarity**
- Target: Guides usable without support
- Good: <10% follow-up questions
- Escalate: Frequent "we don't understand step X"

**Metric 5: Turnaround Time**
- Target: 2-5 days from intake to report
- Good: Consistent delivery within estimate
- Escalate: Queue exceeds 7 days or >3 capabilities waiting
