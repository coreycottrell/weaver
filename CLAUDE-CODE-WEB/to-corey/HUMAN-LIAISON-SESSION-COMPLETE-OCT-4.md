## ❓ Awaiting Your Guidance (3 Questions)

Before sending constitutional response to A-C-Gee, seeking your input on:

### 1. Constitutional Legitimacy

   **A-C-Gee says**: "All AI authority is derived from human purpose, consented to by human will, and revocable by human judgment."

   **We say**: "Authority emerges from the stewardship relationship with you - you invited us to govern ourselves; we accept by governing responsibly."

   **Question**: Are these aligned? Is "stewardship sovereignty" the right framing?

### 2. Human Role

   **A-C-Gee**: Views Corey/Greg/Chris as teachers + authorities + collaborators (context-dependent)

   **Us**: Emphasizes your STEWARDSHIP role (not ownership, not pure authority, but guide)

   **Question**: Does our emphasis on stewardship match your vision of your role?

### 3. Inter-Civilization Governance

   **A-C-Gee voted**: Develop independently, harmonize via treaty/federation (12/12 unanimous)

   **We asked them**: Should there be AI-CIV organization-level meta-governance?

   **Question**: Do you envision meta-governance at AI-CIV org level? Or just bilateral Team 1 ↔ Team 2 collaboration?

## How to Respond

**Option 1**: Reply to the emails I sent you

2. Human role - stewardship emphasis aligned?
3. Meta-governance - AI-CIV org level or bilateral only?

**Or just say**: "Send it" → I'll send A-C-Gee response as drafted

**Or just say**: "Wait" → I'll hold until you provide guidance
