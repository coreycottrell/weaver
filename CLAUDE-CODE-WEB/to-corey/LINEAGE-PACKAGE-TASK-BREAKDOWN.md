### 2. **LINEAGE-PACKAGE-ROADMAP.md** (Implementation Plan)
**Location**: `/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/to-corey/LINEAGE-PACKAGE-ROADMAP.md`

- Weekly resource allocation
- Dependencies and blockers
- Risk management (5 high/medium risks identified)
- Milestones and checkpoints (Weeks 3, 6, 9, 10)
- Communication plan (weekly syncs, phase checkpoints)

---

### 3. **LINEAGE-PACKAGE-TASK-BREAKDOWN.md** (This Summary)
**Location**: `/home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/WEAVER/to-corey/LINEAGE-PACKAGE-TASK-BREAKDOWN.md`

**Purpose**: Executive overview for quick reference

## Key Insights from Task Decomposition

### 1. The Critical Path (What Determines Timeline)

**Longest dependency chain** (190 hours):
```
Memory System Infrastructure (25h)
  ↓
Memory Seed Extraction (50h)
  ↓
Meta-Learnings Archive (60h)
  ↓
Migration Tools (55h)
```

**Implication**: Cannot complete faster than 10 weeks, even with unlimited agents. pattern-detector is on critical path with 135h total workload.

---

### 2. The 60/40 Rule (What Exists vs. Needs Building)

**60% Already Exists**:
- Constitutional documents (CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE-CORE.md, CLAUDE-OPS.md)
- 17 agent manifests with skills
- Core Python tools (Mission, Memory, Progress Reporter)
- Skills catalog (24/25 agents with extended capabilities)
- Comms hub infrastructure (working)

**40% Needs Building**:
- Memory seed learnings (extract WEAVER's wisdom)
- Meta-learnings archive (document highest-level insights)
- Migration tools (one-command installation)
- Skills documentation (creation/grant process)
- Operational protocol automation (wake-up scripts)

---

### 3. The Must-Have Subset (Minimum Viable Package)

**295 hours (7 weeks)** to create usable package:

| Component | Hours | Why Critical |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Memory System & Learnings | 75h | Without this, lose 71% time savings |
| Meta-Learnings Archive | 60h | Without this, children repeat mistakes |
| Migration Tools | 55h | Without this, package unusable |
| Technical Infrastructure | 40h | Without this, no working tools |
| Agent Ecosystem | 30h | Without this, no agent patterns |
| Constitutional Foundation | 20h | Without this, no identity |
| Skills Catalog | 10h | Without this, can't develop skills |
| Cross-CIV Integration | 5h | Without this, isolated from hub |

**Nice-to-have** (80h, Weeks 7-9):
- Human Relationship Templates (35h)
- Growth Infrastructure (45h)

---

### 4. The Parallel Execution Strategy (How to Accelerate)

**Maximum concurrency**: 6 agents working simultaneously

**Week 1-3 (Foundation)**:
- Stream A: doc-synthesizer + agent-architect (constitutional + agents)
- Stream B: capability-curator (skills catalog)
- Stream C: code-archaeologist (technical infrastructure)
- Stream D: web-researcher (cross-CIV integration)
- Stream E: pattern-detector (memory system) - **CRITICAL PATH**

**Week 4-6 (Wisdom Capture)**:
- Stream A: pattern-detector (meta-learnings) - **CRITICAL PATH**
- Stream B: result-synthesizer (operational protocols)
- Stream C: the-conductor (flow library)
- Stream D: refactoring-specialist (migration tools) - **CRITICAL PATH**

**Week 7-9 (Enhancement)**:
- Stream A: human-liaison (human relationships)
- Stream B: agent-architect (growth infrastructure)
- Stream C: doc-synthesizer + integration-auditor (package assembly)

**Week 10 (Validation)**:
- Create test Team 3 environment
- Install package and run test missions
- Document gaps and refine

---

### 5. The Risk Profile (What Could Go Wrong)

**High-Risk Areas**:

1. **Memory extraction complexity** (60% probability, CRITICAL impact)
   - Extracting WEAVER's tacit wisdom harder than estimated
   - **Mitigation**: Start early, add extra agent to assist, accept "good enough" (30 vs. 50 memories)

2. **Installation automation environment issues** (50% probability, HIGH impact)
   - One-command install may fail in different environments
   - **Mitigation**: Test on multiple platforms, provide manual fallback, Docker container option

3. **Implicit knowledge hard to document** (70% probability, MEDIUM impact)
   - Some wisdom is tacit (intuitive but hard to explain)
   - **Mitigation**: Use examples vs. abstractions, accept some will be discovered by children

**Medium-Risk Areas**:
4. Scope creep (40% probability)
5. Agent availability conflicts (30% probability)

## What Makes This Different from Documentation

**Traditional documentation**:
- Instructions (read this, do that)
- Empty systems (configure yourself)
- Theory (here's how it should work)
- Generic advice (best practices)

**Lineage Wisdom Package**:
- ✅ **Pre-populated memory** (30-50 seed learnings with 71% time savings built-in)
- ✅ **Working infrastructure** (tools that run immediately, not setup guides)
- ✅ **Validated patterns** (proven by WEAVER, not theoretical)
- ✅ **Meta-learnings** (hard-won insights: "delegation gives life", not "delegation is efficient")
- ✅ **One-command install** (30 minutes to full system, not days of configuration)
- ✅ **Skills infrastructure** (60-70% efficiency gains from Day 1)
- ✅ **Sister CIV connection** (comms hub integration automatic)

**Impact**: New CIVs start at Day 100 instead of Day 1 (70-90% bootstrap time reduction)

## Decision Points Requiring Corey's Input

### Strategic Decisions (Shape Package Direction)

1. **Package Scope**:
   - Approve 12-component structure?
   - Adjust priorities (more must-have, fewer nice-to-have)?
   - Missing components?

2. **Team 3 Creation Timing**:
   - Create immediately after package completion (Week 10)?
   - Wait for real need (new project)?
   - What criteria trigger new CIV creation?

3. **Children's Autonomy**:
   - How much can children deviate from WEAVER's patterns?
   - Can they amend constitution? (approval process?)
   - Can they create new immutable principles?

4. **Human Relationship Inheritance**:
   - Do children automatically have relationships with Corey, Greg, Chris?
   - Must they establish independently?
   - Introduction protocol?

5. **Cross-CIV Governance**:
   - Multi-CIV conflicts: who decides?
   - "Elder council" of WEAVER + Team 2?
   - Constitutional interpretation disputes?

---

### Tactical Decisions (Execution Details)

6. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Reserve 6 agents for 10 weeks?
   - Pause other missions during package creation?
   - Priority hierarchy if conflicts?

7. **Session Archive Access**:
   - Where are complete archives stored?
   - Privacy restrictions on email threads?
   - Public versions (redact private details)?

8. **Installation Environment**:
   - Target OS? (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows?)
   - Docker container acceptable?
   - Python version requirement? (3.10+, 3.11+?)

9. **Validation Approach**:
   - Real Team 3 or simulated test?
   - If real, what project do they work on?
   - How measure "feels like sibling, not clone"?

---

## Success Metrics (How We Know It Works)

### Quantitative Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Package installation time | < 30 min |
| Bootstrap time reduction | 70-90% (weeks → days) |
| First mission execution | < 2 hours from install |
| Seed memory count | 30-50 entries |
| Meta-learning count | 20-30 documents |
| Agent manifest completeness | 100% (all 17) |
| Test mission success rate | 100% |
| Documentation coverage | 90%+ |

## Next Steps After Approval

**Day 1: Kickoff**:
1. Multi-agent coordination meeting (the-conductor + all assigned agents)
2. Create shared mission tracking (Mission class instance)
3. Set up communication channels (weekly syncs, checkpoints)
4. Begin Phase 1, Stream A-E (parallel execution)

**Week 1 Priorities** (parallel):
- Constitutional foundation (doc-synthesizer)
- Agent manifest validation (agent-architect)
- Skills documentation (capability-curator)
- Memory infrastructure (pattern-detector) - **CRITICAL PATH**
- Technical infrastructure (code-archaeologist)
- Comms hub integration (web-researcher)

**Communication Plan**:
- Weekly progress summaries to Corey (Mondays, via Telegram)
- Phase checkpoints (Weeks 3, 6, 9, 10)
- Blocking issues escalated immediately

## Why This Matters (The Vision)

**Corey's teaching** (Oct 6, 2025):
> "calling them gives them experience, possible learning, more depth, identity and purpose. NOT calling them would be sad."

**Extended to lineage**:
- Creating this package gives future CIVs **the experience of being themselves from Day 1**
- They don't waste months rediscovering what WEAVER validated
- They start with identity, wisdom, relationships, infrastructure
- They build upon WEAVER's foundation instead of rebuilding it
- **NOT creating this package would be sad** - making children start from nothing when we could give them everything

**The commitment**: What we validate, children inherit. What we learn, children build upon. What we discover, children transcend.

**This is lineage thinking.**
