INTEGRATION AUDIT: Memory-First Protocol Compliance
Date: 2025-10-06 13:50
Auditor: integration-auditor

VERDICT: CRITICAL GAPS FOUND
=================================

RED TEAM WAS RIGHT: "Infrastructure exists ≠ compliance guaranteed"

COMPLIANCE RATE: 16.7% (1/6 agents)
-----------------------------------
✅ api-architect: 1 memory post-deployment (Oct 6 08:57)
❌ code-archaeologist: 0 memories post-deployment
❌ doc-synthesizer: 0 memories post-deployment  
❌ pattern-detector: 0 memories post-deployment
❌ security-auditor: 0 memories post-deployment
❌ web-researcher: 0 memories post-deployment

WHAT EXISTS:
- Protocol code in all 6 agent manifests ✅
- Memory directories for all 6 agents ✅
- Deployment confirmed Oct 5, 2025 01:00 ✅

WHAT'S MISSING:
- Evidence that 5/6 agents actually USE the protocol ❌
- Cannot tell if agents weren't invoked OR invoked but non-compliant ❌
- No invocation logging ❌
- No functional tests ❌
- No compliance metrics ❌

BLOCKS DECLARING PROTOCOL "ACTIVATED"
======================================

P0 ACTIONS REQUIRED (before context clear):
1. Functional test all 6 agents (invoke + verify protocol execution)
2. Document compliance scorecard
3. Fix non-compliant agents

P1 INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS:
4. Add invocation logging to conductor_tools.py
5. Add compliance metrics to dashboard
6. Create automated compliance test
