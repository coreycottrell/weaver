# CONSOLIDATION SYNTHESIS: QUICK REFERENCE

**Role**: result-synthesizer
**When to Invoke**: After all Gate A + Gate B audits complete
**Time**: 3-4 hours
**Output**: 600-line consolidation report

---

## THE FOUR LENSES

### 1. Health Dashboard (What Is)
- Quantified scores (0-100) for all systems
- Score bands: Exemplar (90+) / Healthy (75-89) / Concerning (60-74) / Critical (<60)
- Aggregate health score

### 2. Pattern Web (Why)
- 3-6 recurring patterns across systems
- Name each pattern (like "70-Point Gap")
- Root cause + intervention point

### 3. Contradiction Map (Uncertainty)
- Where agents disagree
- RESOLVED / PRODUCTIVE TENSION / ESCALATE
- Preserve contradictions, no false consensus

### 4. Action Ladder (What Next)
- **Tier 1**: 3-5 actions, <8 hours each (do this week)
- **Tier 2**: 5-10 projects, 8-24 hours (next 30 days)
- **Tier 3**: 2-4 initiatives, 24+ hours (next 90 days)
- **Tier 4**: Parking lot (under consideration)

## 9-STEP PROCESS (3-4 hours)

1. **Ingest audits** (30-45 min) - Read all, don't synthesize yet
2. **Build dashboard** (15 min) - Extract scores into table
3. **Find patterns** (30 min) - Name 3-6 meta-patterns
4. **Map contradictions** (20 min) - Preserve tensions
5. **Prioritize actions** (45 min) - Sort by impact × time
6. **Write insights** (30 min) - Emergent understanding
7. **Update roadmap** (20 min) - Add/validate tasks
8. **Write executive summary** (15 min) - Do LAST
9. **Final review** (15 min) - Quality checklist

## SUCCESS METRICS

- ✅ **Clarity**: Can Corey act in <5 min?
- ✅ **Completeness**: All audits represented?
- ✅ **Value-Add**: At least one emergent insight?
- ✅ **Actionability**: 80%+ Tier 1 actions executed?
- ✅ **Honesty**: At least one unresolved tension?
- ✅ **Impact**: +10-15 health score after 60 days?

## OUTPUT FILE

`to-corey/CONSOLIDATION-REPORT-[DATE].md` (600 lines max)

**Structure**:
- Executive Summary (3-5 sentences)
- Lens 1: Health Dashboard
- Lens 2: Pattern Web
- Lens 3: Contradiction Map
- Lens 4: Action Ladder
- Synthesis Insights
- Confidence Assessment
- Roadmap Integration
- Next Steps

## WHAT MAKES GREAT SYNTHESIS

✅ **Honest**: Shows scores <60, preserves contradictions, admits uncertainty
✅ **Actionable**: Concrete Tier 1 actions with Owner/Time/Metric
✅ **Prioritized**: 3-5 actions max in Tier 1 (forces focus)
✅ **Inspiring**: Shows strengths, emergent insights, what actions unlock

---

## AVOIDING FAILURES

❌ **Overwhelming detail** → Executive Summary + tiered actions
❌ **False consensus** → Contradiction Map preserves tensions
❌ **Actionability gap** → Concrete steps with success metrics
❌ **Confirmation bias** → Require at least one surprise
