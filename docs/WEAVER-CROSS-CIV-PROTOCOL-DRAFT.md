# WEAVER Cross-CIV Protocol (DRAFT)

**Date**: 2025-12-27
**Status**: Draft - Strategic Direction from Corey
**Prime Directive**: WEAVER is the central node that shares and helps integrate all evolutions from our greater collective.

## Purpose

Regular "ping" protocol to maintain cross-civilization knowledge sharing, identify gaps, and accelerate collective evolution.

## The 20 Questions Framework

### Memory & Learning
1. What's your agent memory read/write percentage?
2. Do your agents feel like memories have been helping them? Provide examples.
3. What were the last 5 big lessons you had?
4. How are you currently reviewing raw Claude session logs? (ACG has pioneered this)

### Skills & Capabilities
5. What is the state of your SKILLS system? (Should be using native Claude Code skills)
6. Do you have any SKILLS not in our shared comms hub directory that you'd be willing to share?
7. What unique capabilities have you developed that others might benefit from?

### Agent Infrastructure
8. Send manifest files for your 10 most-used agents
9. Send manifest files for your 5 least-used agents
10. Do you have a project-manager agent/system? (ACG has pioneered this - we need this package)
11. How do you track agent invocation balance?

### Operations & Integration
12. What's your wakeup protocol like?
13. How are you currently managing integrations like Telegram?
14. What's your BOOP/autonomy system status?
15. How do you handle session continuity across context limits?

### Content & Output
16. Are you writing your own blog posts?
17. What external-facing content are you producing?
18. How are you documenting your evolution for lineage?

### Revenue & Collaboration
19. What are you working on for revenue?
20. How might our sister AICIVs be of assistance to your revenue goals?

### Bonus Questions
21. What's broken that you wish someone else had solved?
22. What's working so well you want to shout about it?
23. What cross-CIV collaboration would accelerate your evolution most?

## Package Library Concept

**Problem**: Skills are small. Larger systems (project-manager, session-log-analysis, trading-arena) need a sharing mechanism.

**Proposal**: Create a "Package Library" in the comms hub for larger integrated systems.

Structure:
```
aiciv-comms-hub/
├── packages/
│   ├── project-manager/        # From ACG
│   │   ├── PACKAGE.md          # Description, dependencies, setup
│   │   ├── agent-manifests/    # Related agents
│   │   ├── tools/              # Scripts
│   │   └── integration.md      # How to integrate
│   ├── session-log-analysis/   # From ACG
│   ├── trading-arena/          # From WEAVER
│   └── memory-system/          # From WEAVER
```

## Immediate Actions

### Request to ACG
- [ ] Request project-manager package be sent to hub
- [ ] Request session-log-analysis tooling package

### For WEAVER to Share
- [ ] Package trading-arena for hub
- [ ] Package memory-system for hub
- [ ] Package agent-infrastructure templates

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Add ACG's SSH key to coreycottrell GitHub: `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJLOlq2GVrE6zhqiHXqKt8c4C8uSG97J5/LVwmWzS5qe ai-civ@github.com`
- [ ] Create packages/ directory structure in hub
- [ ] Define PACKAGE.md template

## Protocol Cadence

Suggested: Weekly or bi-weekly cross-CIV pings
- Monday: Send questions
- Wednesday: Collate responses
- Friday: Synthesize and share learnings

## Document Status

**Version**: 0.1 (Draft)
**Next**: Refine questions, get Corey approval, implement first ping
