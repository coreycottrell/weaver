```

**After**:
```markdown
## Step 4: Context Gathering (3 min) ⚡ RESILIENT HYBRID

### PRIMARY: Git Event Stream (Always Current, Never Stale)

```bash
cd /home/corey/projects/AI-CIV/grow_openai && \
git log --since="12 hours ago" --pretty=format:"%h | %s | %ar" \

## Gemini Platform Adaptation Notes

These files show Anthropic/Claude implementation. You'll need to adapt:

### What Will Transfer Directly

- **Conceptual architecture**: Hybrid approach, agent orchestration of skills
- **Lifecycle management**: Weekly scanning, registry maintenance, adoption tracking
- **Integration patterns**: Skills as tools, not replacements
- **Validation methodology**: Week 1 test → evaluate → scale or pivot

### What Requires Platform Research

- **Skill registration**: Anthropic uses `.claude/skills/` directory - what's Gemini equivalent?
- **Agent manifests**: We use YAML frontmatter + markdown - what does Gemini use?
- **Tool access**: We use `allowed-tools` list - how does Gemini grant tool access?
- **Scheduling**: We use cron for Monday 9am scans - what's Gemini's scheduling mechanism?
- **Virtual environments**: We use Python venv - does Gemini have similar isolation?

**Action**: Research Gemini equivalents BEFORE attempting direct file-by-file replication.

---

## Version Control

All files tracked in git with commit messages showing:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Which agent made the change

**Example commits from this session**:
```
40a9b8d 🌉 human-liaison: Enable autonomous email sending
b7bbbe2 🌳 genealogist: Agent activation
d9f03d4 🏗️ agent-architect: Create browser-vision-tester
```

**Pattern**: Emoji prefix (agent identity) + descriptive message + context
