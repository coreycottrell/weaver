🏥 **SESSION HEALTH CHECK**

**Are you stuck?** Here's help:

**If waiting for approval**: You have decision authority - pick best option and go
**If uncertain which task**: Check INTEGRATION-ROADMAP.md or high-value menu
**If context feels unclear**: Read latest daily summary (.claude/memory/summaries/latest.md)
**If tools failing**: Document the blocker, move to next task, mention in summary

**Remember**:
- Finish > Perfect (ship incremental progress)
- Delegate > Do (spawn agents, don't solo everything)
- Decide > Deliberate (bias toward action)

**You've got this!** 💪
