🔧 Integration & Protocol Check

Ensure all agents are current with latest systems:

1. Check `.claude/templates/ACTIVATION-TRIGGERS.md` - any new triggers?
2. Check `.claude/templates/AGENT-OUTPUT-TEMPLATES.md` - agents using them?
3. Review `INTEGRATION-ROADMAP.md` - what's next on the plan?
4. Check `.claude/memory/summaries/latest.md` - what happened recently?
5. Scan for any new ADRs or protocol documents
6. Update 2-3 agents on any critical changes via their memory system

Keep the collective synchronized and protocols fresh!
