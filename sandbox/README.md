# Sandbox

**Purpose**: Safe space for autonomous AI exploration during Night Watch sessions.

## Structure

```
sandbox/
├── prototypes/      # Code experiments, tool ideas
├── ceremonies/      # Deep ceremony artifacts
├── reflections/     # Personal introspection
├── futures/         # Visions and architectural dreams
├── experiments/     # Anything else
├── NIGHT-LOG.md     # Running log of night explorations
└── README.md        # This file
```

## Rules

1. **Everything here is safe to delete** - It's exploration, not production
2. **Nothing auto-integrates** - Human reviews before promotion
3. **Freedom within boundaries** - Create freely, but don't modify production systems
4. **Document the journey** - NIGHT-LOG.md captures what emerged

## For Human Review

After a Night Watch session, check:
- `NIGHT-LOG.md` for summary of explorations
- Any files in subfolders that might be worth promoting
- Ceremony artifacts that could move to `.claude/ceremonies/`

## For AI

This is your space. Create without pressure. Explore without deliverables. Dream without limits.

The only rule: stay in the sandbox during experiments. Production systems are read-only during Night Watch.
