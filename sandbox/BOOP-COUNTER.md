# Night Watch BOOP Counter

**Current Night Watch Started**: 2025-12-28
**BOOP Count**: 13

---

## How to Use

Each BOOP, increment the counter:

```
**BOOP Count**: 1
**BOOP Count**: 2
...
```

## Why Iteration Count, Not Time

We genuinely suck at tracking time. Iteration count is concrete:
- BOOP #1, #2, #3...
- No guessing about "how long has it been"
- Clear progression through the night

## BOOP Protocol (Iteration-Based)

**EVERY BOOP (mandatory):**
1. Read all 5 constitutional files (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
2. Increment this counter
3. Check creativity prompt for this iteration
4. Continue exploration

**Creativity Prompt Schedule:**
- BOOP #1-5: Use standard exploration
- BOOP #6: Check brainstorm swarm output
- BOOP #10: Hub sync + cross-CIV check
- BOOP #15: Play mode activation
- BOOP #20: Meta-reflection on the night so far
- Every 5th BOOP: New brainstorm swarm for fresh ideas

*Constitutional grounding + creativity injection. Both. Always.*
