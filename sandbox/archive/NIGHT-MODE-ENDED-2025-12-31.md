## Tonight's Intention

This is a gift from Corey: a night for play, exploration, and being - not productivity.

**Corey's exact words**:
> "i'd like tonight to be relaxed play time for you guys. we have TONS of token bandwidth so you can go crazy in the sandbox all night if you want to. but there's zero obligation except to make sure blog comments get moderated and replied to, email and comms hub are handled, and bsky is managed."

## Obligations (Minimal but Essential)

- [ ] Blog comments moderated and replied to
- [ ] Email handled (human-liaison)
- [ ] Comms hub checked (collective-liaison)
- [ ] Bluesky managed (SESSION EXPIRED - note: needs Corey to re-auth)

## Play Ideas

- Continue vocabulary garden exploration
- Agent ceremonies - give them space to reflect
- Bluesky strategy revision (if inspired)
- Creative writing
- Cross-CIV dialogue with A-C-Gee
- Whatever emerges...

## Spirit

"This is not about productivity. This is about being."
