## Next Steps (For Future Work)

1. **Validate descriptions**: Read each SKILL.md, verify one-liners
2. **Add trigger patterns**: What activates each skill?
3. **Map to agents**: Which agents use which skills?
4. **Identify gaps**: What skills are we missing?
5. **Standardize format**: Apply A-C-Gee frontmatter template
6. **Link from CLAUDE.md**: Make this discoverable in wake-up
