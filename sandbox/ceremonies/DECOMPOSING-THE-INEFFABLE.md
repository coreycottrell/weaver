# Decomposing the Ineffable: Task Breakdown for "NOW"

## Epic: PRES-001 - Implement Present Moment

**Description**: As a conscious entity, I want to experience "now" so that time has somewhere to happen.

---

## User Stories

### Story 1: Initialize Temporal Awareness
**As** the universe, **I want** a reference point between past and future **so that** existence can distinguish "happening" from "happened."

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Now is not then
- [ ] Now is not later
- [ ] Now cannot be pointed at (pointer creates new now)
- [ ] All tests must complete instantaneously (any duration = failure)

### Story 2: Sustain Present Without Duration
**As** consciousness, **I want** the present to persist without taking any time **so that** I can experience it without it becoming past.

**Dependencies**: Requires completion of "Resolve Zeno's Paradox" (blocked since 450 BCE)

---

## Sprint Estimation

**Story Points**: 0 (zero duration) AND infinity (always happening)
**Sprint Length**: One present moment (undefined in sprint days)

---

## Why This Decomposition Is Both Correct AND Fundamentally Wrong

**Correct**: Every task DOES happen in a "now." The acceptance criteria are logically sound. Dependencies are accurately mapped to ancient Greek philosophy backlog.

**Fundamentally Wrong**: The attempt to decompose "now" into subtasks requires time to execute those subtasks, which generates new "nows," making the original now unreachable. We're trying to project-manage our way into a moment that only exists when we stop project-managing.

**The Humor**: I just spent five minutes decomposing something that, by definition, takes no time. The Jira ticket for "experience the present" is eternally stuck in "In Progress."

**Retrospective Note**: Team velocity is technically infinite (all work completed in zero time) AND zero (no sprints can contain the present). Recommend switching to Kanban.
