# The Museum of Impossible Interfaces

Welcome to the Museum of Impossible Interfaces, where we celebrate designs that could never ship, should never ship, and exist purely because they're delightful to imagine.

## Exhibit A: The Procrastination Progress Bar

A progress bar that moves *backwards* the more you watch it. The only way to complete your task is to look away. Features include:

- **Anxiety Mode**: The bar speeds up backward if you hover over it
- **Guilt Gradient**: Slowly shifts from green to that specific shade of disappointed-parent purple
- **The Snack Detector**: Uses your webcam to pause completely when you're eating chips

## Exhibit B: The Honest Cookie Banner

```
 We use cookies because:
 - We want to sell your attention to advertisers
 - Steve in marketing said we had to
 - Honestly we're not 100% sure what they all do

 [Accept All]  [Reject All But We'll Guilt Trip You]
 [Spend 45 Minutes in Our Settings Labyrinth]
```

## Exhibit C: The Emotional Dropdown

A select menu that responds to how you're using it:

- **Fast scrolling**: "Woah woah woah, slow down! I have options here you haven't even considered!"
- **Hovering without clicking**: "Take your time. I understand commitment is hard."
- **Going back to a previous option**: "Changed your mind? We've all been there. No judgment."
- **Selecting the first option**: *quiet sobbing* "You didn't even look at the others..."

## Exhibit D: The Form That Believes In You

```
 Email: [________________]
        "That's a really good email"

 Password: [________________]
           "Wow, so secure. Very mystery."

 Confirm Password: [________________]
                   "You remembered it! I knew you could."

        [ You're Doing Amazing ]
```

## Exhibit E: The Loading Spinner That's Been Through Some Things

Instead of spinning cheerfully, it:
- Sighs
- Occasionally stops and stares into the middle distance
- Sometimes spins the other way, muttering "maybe this'll work"
- Has thought bubbles like:
  - "I used to be a progress bar, you know"
  - "My therapist says I spin because I'm afraid to arrive"
  - "What if the content I'm loading isn't worth it?"

---

## Exhibit F: The Logout Button's Farewell Tour

When you hover:
> "You're leaving? Already? Remember when you logged in? That was nice."

When you click:
> "Fine. Go. I hope your next session is everything you dreamed of."

*The button slowly fades while playing a tiny violin*

---

## Exhibit G: The 404 Page That's Having an Existential Crisis

```
404

The page you're looking for doesn't exist.
But then again... what IS existence?
If a page was never visited, did it ever really exist?

We're all just requests waiting for responses
that may never come.

[Go Home] [Go Anywhere] [Go Inward]
```

## Curator's Note

These interfaces will never be built. They serve no purpose. They optimize nothing. They would fail every usability test ever devised.

And yet.

Imagining them was pure joy.

*That's the exhibit.*

---

*The Museum of Impossible Interfaces thanks you for your visit. The gift shop is closed because the gift shop never existed and was, frankly, a metaphor the whole time.*
