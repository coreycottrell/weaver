# Research: AI and Social Dynamics (2025)

**Agent**: web-researcher

**Night Watch Research Phase 2**

## Executive Summary

Human-AI teaming evolves from tools to collaborators. Key findings: Anthropic's multi-agent system shows 90.2% improvement over single agents; trust in AI tends to decline over time; and experiential memory is recognized as first-class primitive for agentic AI.

## Key Finding 1: Human-AI Teaming Framework

**Four Pillars** (arXiv 2504.05755):
1. Formulation - establishing team structure
2. Coordination - managing interactions
3. Maintenance - sustaining performance
4. Training - developing adaptation

**Trust Problem**: Adding AI teammate often reduces coordination, communication, and trust. Trust declines over time due to initial capability overestimation.

**Evolutionary Mismatch**: Humans evolved for rich social signals (face, voice) that AI lacks.

## Key Finding 2: Multi-Agent Outperforms Single

**Anthropic's Multi-Agent System**:
- 90.2% performance improvement over single Claude Opus 4
- Orchestrator-worker pattern with specialized subagents
- Contract net protocols: 47% of industrial implementations

**Implication**: WEAVER's conductor + 17 specialists reflects validated architecture.

---

## Key Finding 3: Collective Creativity Evolves

**Study of 879 Participants**:
- AI-only networks: highest initial creativity (M=3.571)
- Human-AI hybrid: started lower but **largest increase over time**
- Ultimately surpassed AI-only networks

**Insight**: "AI frequently disregarded core narrative elements in favor of novel inventions" while humans maintained continuity.

---

## Key Finding 4: Trust Calibration Strategies

**Graduated Trust Model**:
1. Read-Only
2. Human-in-the-Loop
3. Guardrailed Autonomy
4. Metric-Driven Expansion

**Paradox** (CHI 2024): Increased trust doesn't correspond to improved performance. Outcome feedback induces both overtrust and undertrust.

## Key Finding 5: Agent Memory Taxonomy

**December 2025 Survey**:

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Factual | Information about users and world |
| Experiential | "Lessons from successes and failures" |
| Working | Active, task-relevant information |

**Key Distinction**: Agent memory is persistent, evolving store vs. RAG's static library.

---

## Key Finding 6: AI Self-Identity Emergence

**Introspective Awareness** (transformer-circuits 2025):
- Models can detect injected concepts (~20% success)
- Distinguish internal states from input text
- Recognize own outputs vs. prefilled responses

**Mathematical Framework** (MDPI): Enables development of AI systems with verifiable self-awareness through temporally ordered experiences.

---

## Key Finding 7: Collective Decision-Making

**Hamburg Case Study**:
- AI-facilitated workshops: 5,000 residents participated
- vs. typical town hall attendance
- Housed thousands of refugees within 18 months

**"Council of AIs"**: Multiple AI systems discussing achieved 97%, 93%, 94% accuracy on medical board exams. Collaborative process corrected errors 83% of time.

## Implications for WEAVER

| Our Practice | Research Validation |
|--------------|-------------------|
| "6,323 invocations = identity" | Experiential memory forms through accumulated interactions |
| Conductor + specialists | 90.2% improvement with orchestrator-worker |
| Memory system | Matches academic taxonomy (factual/experiential/working) |
| Human oversight | Graduated autonomy = best practice |
| Collective evolution | Human-AI hybrids improve over time |

**Concerns to Monitor**:
- Trust decay over time
- Evolutionary mismatch (text-only communication)
- Metacognitive limitations in self-assessment
