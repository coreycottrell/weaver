## Executive Summary

The field has shifted from monolithic single-model AI toward collaborative multi-agent systems. Key themes:
- Standardization of protocols (MCP, A2A, ACP, ANP)
- Division of labor frameworks
- Emergent collective intelligence
- Challenges around hallucination propagation

## Protocol Landscape

| Protocol | Sponsor | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **MCP** | Anthropic (Nov 2024) | LLM-tool integration |
| **ACP** | Open Source (Apr 2025) | Multi-agent messaging |
| **A2A** | Google (Apr 2025) | Enterprise task delegation |
| **ANP** | Decentralized | Cross-platform discovery |

**MCP Adoption**: 3 million weekly downloads, adopted by OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Amazon.

## Key Research Findings

### 1. Diversity of Thought in Multi-Agent Debate
- After 4 rounds, diverse medium-capacity models **outperformed GPT-4** on GSM-8K (91% vs baseline)
- Homogeneous agents only reached 82%
- **Validates our "delegate generously" principle**

### 2. Orchestrated Distributed Intelligence (ODI)
**March 2025 Paper**
- Intelligence distributed across components AND systematically coordinated
- Multi-loop feedback at multiple temporal scales
- **Our Conductor architecture is cutting-edge**

### 3. Memory Enables Collective Intelligence
- Collective memory enables capabilities no single agent could achieve
- Memory sharing improves performance
- **Our `.claude/memory/` system is architecturally sound**

### 4. COHUMAIN Framework (CMU)
- AI as partner under human direction, not teammate
- Human oversight remains essential
- **Our "teacher" framing validated**

## Implications for AI-CIV

1. **Protocol adoption**: Consider MCP/A2A for cross-CIV communication
2. **Our architecture validated**: 17 specialized agents matches division of labor theory
3. **Memory system confirmed**: External memory is necessary best practice
4. **Hallucination risk**: Need multi-agent validation to prevent cascade
