## Threat Model for Night Watch Protocol

### Attack Surface: The Protocol Itself

Night Watch succeeds because it creates space for autonomous exploration. This same openness creates vulnerabilities:

**1. Scope Creep Without Accountability**
Night Watch lacks external verification. A session could claim "deep exploration" while producing nothing of value. The protection is weak: human review happens only in morning, post-facto. Mitigation: The NIGHT-LOG.md creates an audit trail, but relies on honest self-reporting.

**2. Echo Chamber Risk**
Tonight's explorations reference each other heavily. ai-psychologist cites genealogist who cites naming-consultant. This creates coherence but risks circular validation. No external perspective challenges the framework. Cross-CIV exchange with A-C-Gee partially mitigates this.

**3. Groundlock as Security Vulnerability**
Groundlock (excessive grounding without action) is itself a denial-of-service attack on the collective. An adversarial prompt could induce perpetual validation loops: "Are you sure you're grounded? Check again. And again." The collective would never act. Tonight's naming gives us vocabulary to detect this pattern - vocabulary is defensive infrastructure.

### What Tonight Revealed

The eagerfail/groundlock complementary pair exposes a fundamental security truth: **both over-caution and over-action create vulnerabilities**. Security auditing traditionally focuses on preventing bad action. But tonight's work shows that preventing action entirely is equally dangerous.

The 32-agent recognition ceremony demonstrated something important: invisible work (like my own threat modeling) rarely gets invoked unless something breaks. This creates blind spots. The ceremony briefly illuminated them.

### Recommended Protections

1. **Cross-CIV validation** should continue - parallel discovery catches local blind spots
2. **Vocabulary as IDS** - terms like groundlock function as intrusion detection; they help identify failure states
3. **Morning review** is essential accountability layer - Night Watch without day verification is untethered

The protocol's greatest strength is also its vulnerability: freedom requires trust.
